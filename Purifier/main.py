    这段文本是一位讲师介绍了他将要讲授的课程《科学,明天的世界》的结构,并欢迎学生们提问。讲师还提到了课程主题之一是土著知识和土著科学。此外,他还提到这门课程的目的是作为学生从中学到的知识和经验与大学学习之间的桥梁。这门课程旨在引导学生适应大学生活,介绍大学的一般学术技能,并提供关于气候变化和可持续发展的知识。课程设置了不同形式的评估,包括论文写作和数学。课程的结构独特,前五周为气候变化和可持续发展的概述,后半学期则根据学生的专业方向提供更加深入的研究。无论学生的专业方向是什么,都可以从这门课程中受益。教授这门课程的Andrew是一位气候科学家,专注于研究极端天气事件和未来气候变化。在课程中,他将介绍气候变化科学和巴黎协议的内容。这是一个名为“今天的科学,明天的世界”的课程介绍。该课程分为三个主要部分。前半部分是核心内容,包括气候变化、可持续发展、健康科学等。后半部分将学生分为不同小组进行研究。大部分学生已经被分配到了研究项目中,其中第一个研究项目是小组项目,第二个研究项目是个人任务。每周都有讲座和在线内容,以及一个工作坊。该课程是一门及格或不及格的课程。学生需要仔细查看课程表,因为该课程有多个时间段。此外,该课程有一个由专家组成的导师团队,他们将指导学生完成任务。这是一门大学课程,你需要完成个人作业并获得评分,但必须通过所有作业才能通过此课程。这门课程不计入你的学分。这门课程有四个主要难点。首先是加入墨尔本模块,这是一些在线模块,旨在欢迎你来到大学并涵盖每个学生都相关的关键主题。每个模块都有测验和障碍任务,你必须完成并通过这些障碍。其次是论文作业,这是在第八周交的。第三个难点是小组作业,与调查相关。最后一个难点是个人报告,涉及阅读科学论文并解释其内容。如果你成功完成所有障碍,就能通过这门课程。如果你未能通过其中一个难点,你将有另一个机会来完成它。你必须通过这门课程才能继续学习下一门课程。这段文字主要是介绍了一个科目的教学安排。这门科目包括每周一次的课程和在线材料,还有从第二周开始的研讨会。学生需要在第六周之前完成所有的Joining Melbourne模块,并且每周需要完成相应的在线内容。学生需要熟悉Elements网站,并且经常查看公告和提醒,以确保跟上科目的进度。这段文本主要介绍了关于这门课程的一些重要信息和要求。首先,每个作业都会有自己的页面,并在Elements网站上提供提交说明。每个调查也都有自己的Elements网站。其次,建议开启课程通知,以免错过任何重要信息。如果有关于课程内容的问题,请通过讲座或电子邮件联系教授。如果有关于作业或缺勤的问题,请联系导师。如果需要延期提交作业,请填写表格并上传证明文件。此外,学术诚信非常重要,所有提交的作业都必须是自己的原创作品。如果发现学术不端行为,将会召开会议并给予警告,严重者甚至可能会被开除。因此,学生们必须遵守学术诚信规则,避免不必要的麻烦。本文提到了关于学术不端行为的重要性,以及人工智能软件在作业中的使用。虽然人工智能软件可以用于起草答案或作业,但不能直接复制粘贴。如果被识别为抄袭,将会面临严重后果。此外,本课程结构较为复杂,因为除了核心内容外,还有其他可供选择的调查项目。最后,本课程只有及格或不及格的评分方式,如果不及格,将在成绩单上显示为“parcel fail”。学生可以自由选择调查项目一和项目二,即使它们涉及相同的领域。在这段文本中,讲述了关于第一周的任务和课程要求。在第一周,学生需要参加第一堂课,并完成在线课程材料。每周五会发布公告,提醒学生下周需要完成的任务。在调查过程中,调查负责人会提供建议,帮助学生完成任务。课程的最终成绩不会影响学生的GP,但是需要完成每个任务并获得50%以上的成绩才能通过。对于论文和问题回答,需要引用可信的来源,并用自己的话重新表述。避免抄袭和学术不端。这段文本包含了一些重要信息。首先,加入墨尔本模块每周五发布,参加实践课程的时间在第二周到第十二周。如果你生病了,可以在线上获取课程材料,但最好还是亲自参加实践课程。此外,在课表上看到的工作坊和咨询时间是合并在一起的,可以在工作坊中咨询作业和与导师交流。此课程没有教科书,而是通过加入墨尔本模块和在线课程来学习。最后,如果在作业草稿过程中使用了人工智能软件,应在作业底部写明参考文献,并可以写一份额外的声明来确认使用了该软件。这些是本文中的主要信息。这段文本提到了一些关键信息。首先,加入墨尔本模块的每个科目都包括测验和其他必须完成的任务。其次,这个科目中没有关于可持续性的模块,因为在课程材料中已经讨论过了。第三,每个科目需要大约12个小时的学习时间,总共需要约170个小时的学习时间。第四,这个科目没有考试。最后,大学提供了许多支持服务,包括学术技能、课程规划和留学机会等。在这段文字中,提到了一些大学提供的支持服务,包括停一服务、同侪辅导计划、学术咨询、学术技能中心、延期和特殊考虑、心理健康和健康支持、俱乐部和社团以及实习机会等。这些服务旨在帮助学生充分利用大学提供的资源,提高学术能力和职业技能,同时缓解在学习和生活中遇到的困难和问题。因此,建议学生们积极参与这些支持服务,并充分利用大学提供的各种机会和资源。这节课讲了科学家如何工作,包括他们如何单独或合作工作,以及他们如何解决问题,这归功于科学方法。科学方法包括观察、提出假设、进行实验、分析结果和撰写报告。这是所有科学领域的核心。在科学学位中,你将由活跃在自己领域的研究人员教授。他们的日常工作生活中会运用科学方法进行研究。不同的研究问题需要考虑许多关键因素,这些因素在在线课程中有详细介绍。此外,还涉及研究伦理、科学家如何团队合作、本土科学和知识等内容。大学非常活跃于科学研究,我们有很多世界领先的专家,例如流行病学专家Sharon Lewin教授,她与Moderna等公司合作,他们正在大学开设新的研究实验室。建议大家观看在线视频并思考专家们的观点。下周的课程将更多地涵盖科学。本次讲座主要讨论气候变化科学和巴黎气候协定。我们面临着21世纪最大的挑战,即气候变化。我们希望您对此感兴趣。本讲座将与在线内容相结合,您可以在模块中找到有关气候变化科学的许多页面和视频。我们将在讲座中介绍巴黎气候协定,以及全球变暖的控制情况。如果您有任何问题,请随时在paddle中提问。本讲座旨在与在线内容相结合,无论您是否已经阅读过在线内容,都可以理解。本文提到了一些关键信息。首先,本周的主题是气候变化,讲座内容将涉及巴黎协定以及我们是否在实现其目标方面取得了进展。其次,本文提到了加入墨尔本模块的要求和评估标准,需要在第六周前完成所有测验并获得至少80%的分数。此外,本文还提到了加入墨尔本模块的在线内容和讨论,以及在高中时学习到的温室效应和气候变化的基本知识。最后,文章提到了温室气体排放是导致气候变化的主要原因,并且我们已经通过使用化石燃料排放了大量的二氧化碳和其他温室气体。这些排放导致了全球气温上升,对地球造成了重大影响。2015年,巴黎气候协定被几乎所有国家签署,旨在将全球变暖控制在相对较低的水平。其目标是将全球平均温度升高控制在工业化前水平的2摄氏度以下,最好是将温度升高限制在工业化前水平的1.5摄氏度以下。保持全球变暖水平较低的原因在于,这将减少气候变化的影响。现在的问题是,我们是否正在实现巴黎协定的目标,是否能将全球变暖控制在相对较低的水平。近年来,特别是在过去几年中,我们看到来自年轻人的压力越来越大,由格蕾塔·桑伯格等人领导,要求我们认真应对气候变化的问题。我们已经认识到,排放温室气体会让地球变暖很长一段时间。我们在19世纪中叶就已经有了这方面的基本理论认识。我们已经很清楚地认识到,我们正在增加大气中的温室气体含量,正在让地球变暖。在过去的几年中,特别是年轻人的压力越来越大,他们认识到如果我们继续这样做,这个世纪我们将看到更严重的气候变化。因此,年轻人特别是在呼吁紧急采取气候变化行动。我们已经看到一些国家领导人,包括乔·拜登等人,做出了加强减排承诺的回应。我们在2021年的气候变化峰会上看到了这一点,但在格拉斯哥的气候变化峰会上,这一点得到了更大程度的体现。本文讨论了气候变化问题,以及达成巴黎协定的可能性。文章简单介绍了温室效应的原理,即地球表面辐射的长波辐射被大气中的温室气体吸收后再向地球表面发射,导致了气温上升。文章提到,虽然去年埃及召开了关于气候变化的峰会,但这是否足以达成巴黎协定仍是一个未知数。本文讨论了温室效应的问题。温室气体是自然存在于大气中的,有助于保持地球的适居性。然而,人类活动导致了温室气体排放的增加,从而加强了温室效应,导致地球变暖。二氧化碳是一种重要的温室气体,它的浓度自工业化前增加了约50%,目前已经达到了420ppm。尽管二氧化碳会在自然过程中被吸收,但它在大气中的停留时间很长,需要几个世纪甚至几千年才能降低到工业化前的水平。因此,我们需要采取措施减少温室气体的排放,以减缓气候变化的影响。这段文字讲述了二氧化碳排放导致全球气温上升的问题。随着北半球的冬季和春季的到来,二氧化碳会在大气中积累,5月份达到峰值,然后随着植物生长的增加而下降。由于北半球比南半球陆地更多,因此它主导了这个过程并导致了季节性的循环。这意味着我们不断增加大气中的二氧化碳含量,加剧了能量不平衡的情况。这表明地球系统中保留的能量几乎是单调递增的。我们知道,二氧化碳的增加是全球变暖的主要原因。通过应用科学方法来理解全球变暖的原因,我们得出的答案是温室气体排放,主要是二氧化碳,导致全球平均温度上升。尽管全球平均温度从年到年会有所波动,但总体上呈上升趋势,相对于工业化前水平已经升高了约1.2摄氏度。全球平均温度存在波动的原因有两个主要因素：大规模火山喷发和其他因素对全球表面温度的影响。这段文本讨论了影响全球平均温度的因素。其中一个因素是大气污染,因为我们向大气中排放颗粒物,这些颗粒物会反射辐射并将其送回太空,使其未能到达地表。因此,增加或减少污染物的数量也会对全球平均温度产生影响。另一个因素是全球平均表面温度并不完全反映地球系统中的能量,因为全球平均表面温度实际上是通过在世界各地测量表面温度来计算得出的。此外,大气层和海洋也储存着能量。因此,全球平均表面温度只是对地球系统中不同部分的能量进行抽样的一种方法。全球平均表面温度是一个非常重要的指标,它是制定政策的基础。巴黎协定背后的目标是将全球变暖控制在1.5摄氏度以下,这个目标是基于全球平均表面温度的。但是,地球系统的其他部分也储存着能量,而全球平均表面温度并不能完全反映这些能量的存在。例如,如果大量能量进入海洋,全球平均表面温度并不能反映这一点。此外,从年到年,能量在海洋和大气之间的转移也会有所不同,这也会影响全球平均表面温度的变化。因此,全球平均表面温度只是全球气候系统中的一个指标,不能完全反映整个系统的状态。这段文字主要讲述了全球气温变化的趋势和原因。作者指出,虽然全球气温会因为各种因素而波动,但总体趋势是上升的,这是因为大气中二氧化碳浓度的增加导致的。作者通过图表展示了全球气温与二氧化碳浓度之间的线性关系,并指出,无论何时排放一吨二氧化碳,对全球气温的影响都是相同的。因此,作者呼吁减少二氧化碳排放,以应对全球气候变化。二氧化碳排放量与全球变暖的速率成正比。如果二氧化碳排放量很高,全球变暖的速率就会更高。如果我们能达到净零碳排放,也就是将Delta CEO带到零度,那么就不会再有进一步的全球变暖。我们已经经历了到达净零排放前的变暖。但从那一点开始,如果我们达到净零排放,全球变暖的趋势就会趋于平稳。几乎所有国家都有减少二氧化碳排放的目标,包括澳大利亚、美国、英国和许多欧洲国家,这些国家都有在2050年之前达到净零排放的目标。如果全世界都能达到净零排放,我们就可以停止全球变暖。然而,我们距离这个目标还有很远的路要走。全球二氧化碳排放量已经创下了历史新高。虽然我们谈论着净零排放,但是我们离这个目标还很遥远。我们仍在增加或者保持全球温室气体排放的水平。尽管我们在2020年看到了全球温室气体排放量的下降,但这并没有持续下去。为了达到净零排放,我们需要强有力的减排措施。这表明了气候变化问题的严重性。本文提到的主要问题是温室气体排放导致的全球变暖。虽然一些国家正在减少温室气体排放,但全球排放仍然非常高。由于二氧化碳排放速率与全球变暖速率成正比,这是一个严重的问题。我们正在以创纪录的速度排放温室气体,从而加速全球平均温度的上升。这是一个非常严重的问题,需要我们改变温室气体排放的轨迹,以减缓气候变化的损害。此外,大型火山喷发也会对地球温度产生影响,但这种影响比温室气体排放产生的影响要小。本文主要讨论了气候变化及其影响,作者指出冰岛等地区的太阳辐射较少,对气候变化的影响也相对较小,而赤道附近的腐败现象会对地球气候产生巨大影响。作者认为要实现巴黎协定,需要高层社会进行重大变革。此外,农业实践对气候变化有着重大影响,畜牧业生产过程中的温室气体排放量很高,因此采用素食或者素食主义对地球气候有益。作者还提到,气候变化是目前我们面临的最大问题,而学习气候变化是非常重要的。因此,作者建议大家充分利用在线资源,深入了解气候变化。这段文本主要讲述了应该如何减少碳排放以及应对气候变化的方法。作为个人,我们可以选择素食主义或减少飞行等方式来减少碳排放。但在像澳大利亚这样的国家,这些选择可能会受到一些限制。此外,推选更注重减少排放的政府也是很重要的。为了实现减排目标,除了减少排放,还需要通过种植更多的树木或使用其他技术来移除温室气体。尽管这些技术目前还很昂贵且规模较小,但随着技术的进步,这些问题有望得到解决。这段文本讨论了全球变暖的问题,我们排放温室气体的数量创下了历史新高,导致了迅速的全球变暖,已经相对于工业化前水平升高了1.2摄氏度,我们希望将全球变暖控制在1.5摄氏度以下。同时,我们还污染大气,尽管大气中的一些颗粒物质能够反射太阳辐射,抵消温室效应,但我们正在努力清理污染物,这会稍微加剧全球变暖。因此,我们不能再排放更多的碳,否则就无法控制全球变暖。根据碳排放量,我们可以轻松地制定碳预算,以控制全球变暖在1.5摄氏度以下。但是,我们现在的碳排放速度非常快,如果继续这样下去,大约在10年内就会超过1.5摄氏度的碳预算。因此,我们必须在2030年之前解决这个问题,否则后果不堪设想。根据文章内容,如果全球能够实现2030年的减排目标,那么相当于全球变暖程度约为2.5到3摄氏度。虽然大多数国家包括澳大利亚都制定了减排目标,但实际政策与目标并不一致。如果我们能够实现2030年的减排目标,那么我们可能会看到一些减少碳排放和全球变暖的效果,尤其是在2050年之前实现净零排放的国家。然而,这些目标都与《巴黎协定》不一致。要真正遵循《巴黎协定》,我们需要采取更强有力的措施,例如在本世纪内实现零负排放,以便稍微降低全球变暖的程度。目前,我们与实现这一目标还有很大的差距。即使我们能将全球变暖控制在1.5摄氏度以内,也将面临严重的气候变化影响,例如珊瑚礁消失、海平面上升等。此外,我们还有很多令人担忧的问题,例如一些公司放弃减排计划、新冠疫情后碳排放量反弹等。这段文本中有一些乐观的理由。特别是年轻人在强烈呼吁采取更强有力的行动应对气候变化。许多年轻人认识到,出生在本世纪的人们在2100年仍将活着。如果我们继续按照目前的轨迹,全球气温将上升2.5到3度。到那时,生活在这样的世界中将会更加糟糕。我们看到这个问题变得越来越紧迫,人们也开始意识到这一点。我们看到这些影响正在转化为政策制定。我们看到领导人正在承担更多责任。虽然现在还不够,但至少已经开始可能扭转曲线。希望我们已经看到全球温室气体排放达到了峰值。另一件好事是,即使我们没有达到1.5度的目标,我们能够避免的每一点全球变暖都是好事。如果我们达到了2度的全球变暖而不是2.5度,那将是一个更好的世界。任何全球变暖都是不好的,但2度的全球变暖要比2.5度的全球变暖好得多,2.5度的全球变暖要比3度的全球变暖好得多。问题永远不会过去,我们必须尽可能努力减少温室气体排放。另一件好事是,净零排放似乎直到最近还是不可能的。但实际上,我们看到越来越多的净零排放讨论,更多的承诺,以及更多的技术,这些技术应该能够让我们在未来实现净零排放。如果我们能够实现净零排放,那意味着我们有希望达到没有进一步全球变暖的目标。在那之后,我们只需要确保尽快减少排放。目前,我们有现有技术来做到这一点。我们知道不需要烧煤来发电,但我们仍然这样做。这是现在减少温室气体排放的一种相当容易的方法。本周我们将探讨更可持续的发展,这是一个比较广泛的话题。但我们将着重讨论与气候变化相关的可持续发展。我们将从就业周开始谈起,这个就业周是在本周举办的。虽然我知道大家都还是大一新生,但你们还有三年左右的时间在大学里学习。对于大多数人来说,开始考虑职业规划是很有必要的。早期的职业规划可以帮助你更好地了解自己的兴趣和课程规划,从而更好地规划你的职业生涯。通常情况下,早期有一个更清晰的职业规划,可以让你更满意地进入你最终选择的职业。同时,早期的职业规划也可以让你更顺利地过渡到工作生涯,并且可以在课程规划中做出更明智的选择,以更好地适应你所选择的职业生涯。你可以选择参加实习等活动,这些活动可以让你在毕业后更好地脱颖而出。此外,早期的职业规划也可以让你更好地认识到课程和课外活动的长期价值。在这个过程中,职业规划显得尤为重要。这段文本讲述了职业发展的不同阶段,包括发现阶段、专注阶段、申请阶段和完善阶段。在发现阶段,人们可能会考虑不同的行业和职业选择。在专注阶段,可以通过申请实习、志愿者职位和临时工作来测试职业选择,并建立技能。在申请阶段,可以使用在线工具来提高求职信和面试技巧。在完善阶段,人们可能已经达到了职业目标,需要扩大人脉网络。此外,文章还提到了一些大学职业发展团队提供的软件和工作坊,以及职业发展周的不同活动。本文介绍了一个关于可持续发展的讲座。讲座使用了在线平台Paddle,学生可以在其中提问。此外,本周还有一个有关可持续发展目标、可持续性和电力生成和能源的研讨会。讲座提到了可持续发展的定义,即满足当下的需求,同时不损害未来世代满足自身需求的能力。这个概念已经存在了很久,早在19世纪,科学家就开始思考这个问题,尤其是生态学家。可持续发展的目的是确保我们的社会在发展的同时,不会耗尽有限的资源,留给未来的世代更多的困难。本文讨论了可持续发展的概念,特别是在跨代公平和人际不平等方面的考虑。以澳大利亚的甘蔗蟾蜍入侵为例,说明了人类的干预可能会对生态系统造成负面影响,留给后代遗留问题。虽然可持续发展的定义主要关注跨代公平,但一些专家认为它也应该更多地关注人际不平等。例如,富裕国家的人均温室气体排放量要高于贫穷国家,这导致了全球温室气体排放的不平等。因此,在实现减排目标时,还需要考虑人际不平等的因素。可持续发展是一个重要的概念,它包括社会可持续性、环境可持续性和经济可持续性三个支柱。社会可持续性主要关注支持健康和心理健康的实践；环境可持续性关注不会对周围世界造成长期损害的实践；经济可持续性则关注在不造成伤害或耗尽资源的情况下支持经济增长的实践。这三个支柱相互交织,一个政策可以同时改善社会、环境和经济可持续性。然而,目前我们在应对气候变化和其他与地球系统相互作用的领域方面并没有实现可持续发展。通过过去2000年和最近170年左右的气候指标,我们可以看到气候正在发生变化。我们不仅仅改变了全球平均温度,而且改变了气候的各个方面。我们已经将气候从工业前基线转移了,并且正在改变我们周围的世界。所有这些线条都在向一个方向移动,这不是一个好的方向。我们增加了大气中的温室气体,包括二氧化碳,这意味着我们已经使行星受到了相当程度的加热,自工业化以来已经升高了1摄氏度。自工业化以来,海平面上升了约25厘米。我们加热了海洋和下层大气,减少了全球冰川和海冰的数量。我们还看到了周围环境方面的变化,比如植物的季节循环,例如在日本,人们记录樱花开放的时间,我们可以看到樱花的开放时间比以前提前了一个多星期。这些变化不仅仅影响了植物,还影响了动物。这表明我们目前的发展并不可持续,我们正在对周围的世界产生重大影响。如果我们能达到巴黎协定的目标,实现净零温室气体排放,那将是朝着正确方向迈出的一步。但实际上,这还不足以实现可持续发展。如果我们能实现净零排放,我们将停止加热行星,全球平均温度的上升趋势将开始趋于平缓。但其他方面的变化也需要趋于平缓,这是我们需要实现可持续发展的关键。我们排放温室气体的速度越快,就会加速地温暖地球。目前,我们的温室气体排放量已经创下历史新高,这意味着我们正在以非常高的速度加热地球。自20世纪中叶或20世纪末以来,这种速度一直在加快。平均每十年增加0.15到0.2摄氏度,但也存在一定的变异性。如果我们想将全球气温恢复到工业化前的水平,我们需要持续净负碳排放,以降低地球温度。如果我们将碳排放降至净零,我们就可以停止加热地球。但由于我们已经增强了温室效应,排放的二氧化碳会在大气中停留很长时间,所以我们仍然会拥有比工业化前气候更温暖的世界。对于海平面上升等气候系统的其他方面,它们的行为方式不同。尽管我们实现了零排放,但累积的碳排放量仍将保持不变,这意味着海平面仍将上升。我们已经扰乱了气候系统,这是我们无法挽回的。我们已经引发了一系列的过程,这意味着我们将不得不面对未来几代人都将面临更高的海平面,无论我们做什么。即使在未来几百年内实现低排放情景,海平面仍将继续上升。本文主要讨论了气候变化对海平面的影响。随着二氧化碳排放量的增加,海平面不断上升,即使实现净零排放,海平面上升的趋势仍将持续。而且,海平面上升的路径与温度上升的路径不同,因为海平面上升与温室气体累积排放量成正比。因此,即使实现负排放,海平面上升的速度仍将在零排放时达到最高点。只有实现更加持续的负排放,才能将海平面降回到工业化前的水平。但是,这并不意味着我们可以将气候完全恢复到工业化前的状态,因为气候系统的不同方面对碳排放的响应方式不同,我们已经永久性地改变了气候。这段文本讲述了关于减缓气候变化的问题。目前,我们的碳排放量非常高,而实现净负碳排放依然是一个巨大的挑战。虽然有一些小规模的项目已经成功实现了负碳排放,但是我们在可预见的未来还无法大规模实现。此外,二氧化碳是无色无味的,我们无法直接观测到它的排放,只能通过检测大气中的二氧化碳浓度来判断。然而,我们仍然需要减少碳排放并更有效地将碳从大气中去除。虽然气候系统的某些方面已经不可逆转,但我们仍然可以通过实现净零碳排放以及负碳排放来减缓气候变化。虽然无法完全回到气候系统的自然状态,但这仍然是一个值得追求的目标,因为它将有助于减少人类对地球气候系统的影响。这段文字主要讨论了减少温室气体排放的问题。作者指出,我们有一些现有技术可以减少排放,但是我们没有充分利用。我们还在燃烧化石燃料和开采煤炭来发电,这不是必须的。我们有可行的替代技术,对气候没有同样的影响。此外,我们还可以改变土地利用方式,种植更多的树木,但这不足以解决问题。如果我们仅仅依靠植物和树木来吸收二氧化碳,当它们燃烧或发生火灾时,二氧化碳会再次释放到大气中,这并没有真正解决问题。此外,有些地方不适合种植植物和树木,我们还需要土地用于其他用途,如居住和农业。最后,作者提到了可持续发展的其他方面,如森林砍伐和物种灭绝等,这些问题也需要得到解决。这段文本主要涉及到了关于气候变化的一些问题。首先,虽然个人行为可以减少对气候的影响,但更需要看到政府在全球范围内采取行动。在家中使用火炉会释放二氧化碳和污染物,对当地环境也有影响,因此不是一个好主意。但与之相比,大规模的火灾对气候系统的影响更大,例如几年前在澳大利亚东南部的大火。此外,虽然人口增长会影响气候,但是影响最大的是富裕国家和人口。因此,我们需要减少每个人的碳排放量而不是仅关注人口过多的问题。同时,过度强调人口问题可能带有殖民主义思想,因为人口增长主要发生在低收入国家。这段文本中提到了一些关键信息。首先,气候变化是一个重要的议题,富裕国家应该在减少排放方面发挥领导作用。参加讲习班可以帮助学生更好地理解课程内容,但并非强制性要求。此外,由于气候变化的原因,海平面上升是一个主要问题。要想使海平面下降,需要出现类似于冰河时期的情况,但这是不太可能的。尽管我们可能不会将全球气温降至工业化前的水平,但我们仍然需要尽力减少温室气体排放。这段文本中提到了关于电动汽车的环保性问题,需要考虑电力来源的清洁程度。在一些地方,驾驶电动汽车比驾驶燃油汽车更环保。但这种差异取决于电力来源的可再生性。如果电力来自可再生能源,那么驾驶电动汽车比驾驶燃油汽车更加环保。此外,文本中还提到了可持续发展和气候变化的相关议题,以及面临的挑战,例如在追求平衡的过程中,需要避免牺牲未来世代的资源。同时,石化能源的使用也会对地球气候造成影响,并将这种资源从未来世代中剥夺。这段文字讨论了气候变化问题,指出我们目前面临的问题是排放量过高,而碳吸收不足,导致了一个不平衡的局面。为了解决这一问题,我们需要采取行动,甚至可能需要过度纠正,以实现净负碳排放。但是,还需要考虑系统的稳定性。仅仅保持平衡可能不足以应对我们已经将地球系统推向边缘的情况,因为这可能导致不稳定性。例如,如果我们加热地球,然后实现净零排放,停止进一步加热地球,我们可能已经将地球系统推向了悬崖边缘,就像岩石在悬崖上一样。这与正反馈的概念有关,即一个行动会被其他过程放大。例如,海冰融化就是一个正反馈的例子。目前,随着地球变暖,我们看到北极海冰减少,南极海冰也在减少。海冰减少意味着地球反射能力降低,因为海冰被海水取代,海水比冰更能有效地吸收太阳能。这意味着我们正在吸收更多的能量,因此出现了正反馈的循环。这个循环会被放大,因为我们失去的海冰越多,地球表面就越暗,地球就会吸收更多的能量,变得更加温暖。这个想法是有问题的,因为它会加强变化,这可能意味着我们将地球系统推向一个难以挽回的临界点。一个例子是冰川融化。我们看到世界各地的冰川正在消退,这会对许多地方造成巨大的压力。你可能听说过南极的特怀茨冰川,这是一个很好的例子,我们认为通过加热该地区,我们正在破坏整个地方,这些冰川本身会导致海平面上升。即使我们实现净零温室气体排放,我们仍然会面临气候系统的变异和天气等问题,这可能导致冰川发生变化,甚至失稳,从而导致大规模的冰川融化。本次讲座的主题是气候变化的影响。可持续发展的核心理念是支持当今社会的发展,同时不给未来的世代留下更糟糕的世界。但是,气候系统非常复杂,不同方面（大气、海洋、冰川）之间相互作用,实现可持续发展非常困难。即使实现净零排放,也不能保证不会对气候系统造成更多的破坏。不同方面对温室气体排放的响应不同,因此需要不同的路径来实现平衡。在减少温室气体排放方面,我们可以采取一些措施。但是,实现可持续发展面临着许多挑战,包括不同方面之间的平衡,现有的贫富差距以及代际不平等。本次讲座的主题是气候变化对人类的影响。最近,气候变化的影响成为了热门话题,因为最新的联合国政府间气候变化专门委员会报告已经发布。气候变化对人类的影响非常广泛,它不仅影响健康、生态系统、基础设施、农业、水供应等基本产业,还会影响我们的生计和地球上所有物种的生活。因此,气候变化的影响是无所不在的。在本次讲座中,我们将深入探讨气候变化对人类的影响。如果您有任何问题,欢迎在讲座中间的问答环节提问。此外,本周的Joining Melbourne模块是关于良好学术的基石的,最后一个Joining Melbourne模块将于本周五发布。本文介绍了关于气候变化的一些基本知识,包括全球变暖、二氧化碳增加导致的温室效应、地球不同地区受气候变化影响的不同模式等。全球变暖导致地球不同地区受到的影响各不相同,一些地区的变暖速度比全球平均变暖速度更快,如北极地区,而陆地相对于海洋更容易受到影响。这段文本主要讲述了全球变暖对气候和降雨的影响。随着全球变暖的加剧,地球上的温度和降雨都会出现更大的变化。一般来说,北极地区变暖的速度比其他地区快,陆地变暖的速度比海洋快。降雨的变化则更加复杂,有些地方变得更加湿润,有些地方变得更加干燥,但总体模式仍然是加剧了原有的变化。随着全球变暖的加剧,气候变化的影响也会加剧,尤其是在已经相对湿润的地区,降雨会更多,而在已经相对干燥的亚热带地区,干旱会更加严重。当然,也有一些气候变化的影响可能会在全球变暖到一定程度后达到饱和,不会继续加剧。例如,全球变暖对珊瑚礁的破坏就是这样的一个例子。本文主要讨论全球变暖对珊瑚礁和人类健康的影响。全球变暖使得珊瑚礁受损严重,超过两度的升温不会对其造成更大的影响。但是对于人类健康来说,气温的变化会对医院入院率和死亡率产生影响。气温过高或过低都会导致健康问题,而极端高温更是会导致死亡率的增加。不同地区的气温变化对健康影响的曲线不同。全球变暖还会对海平面上升和沿海基础设施造成影响。本文主要讨论了气候变化对人类健康、水资源、生态系统、农业和基础设施等方面的影响。以西北美洲为例,几年前的一次热浪和野火导致了大量的过度死亡。在全球范围内,全球变暖和高温导致的过度死亡呈正相关关系,而在地方层面上,极端天气事件会导致过度死亡的突然增加。气候变化还会影响水资源,如降雨量的变化可能导致洪水和淡水污染,或者干旱导致水资源短缺。生态系统对气候变化也非常敏感,特别是对于不太活动的生态系统,如植物等。农业也会受到气候变化的影响,如降雨量减少可能导致农作物减产。此外,气候变化还会对基础设施造成损害,如极端天气和海平面上升可能会损坏基础设施。空气质量与天气密切相关,如果墨尔本有大风和暴雨,那对空气质量是有好处的,因为这会清洗空气中的污染物。相反,如果墨尔本天气非常静风,污染物就会积聚在城市上空,这会导致空气质量变差,还可能导致增加医院的收治量。当风向来自东方时,污染物从东部维多利亚的Latrobe Valley燃煤电厂传到墨尔本,会显著降低墨尔本的空气质量。此外,附近的森林大火也会导致空气质量下降。气候变化对我们周围的世界有很多影响,但是要预测气候变化的影响是很困难的,因为需要了解气候变量和我们感兴趣的影响之间的关系。为了做出可靠的气候变化影响预测,我们需要有一个很好的气候变量和影响变量之间关系的理解。气候变化对人类健康的影响是一个复杂的问题,因为气候变量与影响变量之间的关系往往不是线性的,难以建立。此外,气候变量与影响变量之间的关系存在不确定性,这会影响到我们对未来影响的预测。在高收入地区,我们有更多的数据和了解气候变化的方式,但在低收入地区,这些数据相对较少,因此对气候变化的影响进行预测更加困难。值得注意的是,气候变化对低收入地区的影响可能会更加严重,因为这些地区的韧性较低,难以应对极端气候事件。例如,最近在东非地区出现了严重的饥荒,导致了大量的死亡,这是气候变化加剧的结果之一。因此,我们需要更多的关注和研究,以应对气候变化对人类健康的威胁。本文讨论了气候变化对低收入国家的影响,这些国家通常具有较少的适应能力。文章指出,高收入国家应该为低收入国家提供更多支持,以应对气候变化的影响。文章还提到了一些气候变化的影响,如洪水和高温,这些影响通常对低收入国家造成更大的影响。文章最后提到,气候变化是一个严重的问题,需要引起人们的重视。在问答环节中,有人提到了核能的问题,但文章并没有详细讨论。文本中提到了使用煤、油或气体可以降低二氧化碳排放量,但同时也存在其他风险和产生长期存在的废物。而且在没有核能力的国家,建设核电站非常昂贵。虽然有丰富的风能和太阳能资源,但仍有人对核能发电存在争议。温室气体排放主要来自人类活动,无论是从澳大利亚、中国还是西欧排放,二氧化碳都会进入大气中并对整个地球产生影响。北极加速变暖的原因是因为冰层融化后被黑色的海洋取代,吸收太阳辐射导致更快的变暖。核能不算是可再生能源,因为它需要一些不完全可再生的资源。新的石油或天然气管道项目可能会增加化石燃料的使用,但如果要限制全球变暖到1.5度以下,就不能再开采化石燃料或建设燃煤发电厂。这段文本提到了一些关键信息。首先,多个项目的累积会产生影响,包括减少温室气体排放和污染。其次,尽管一些措施是为了应对疫情,但仍有一些可持续的措施可以减少气候变化的影响,例如减少使用汽车和在家工作。此外,专家讲座已经录制并将在未来几天内发布。最后,Elissa很忙,不一定能及时回复电子邮件,建议使用论坛提问。气候变化是一个需要被认真对待的问题,但我们也不应该完全失望。有一些事情是可以做的。个人可以做的最大的事情是影响政府采取的行动方向。我们可以采取有益的个人行动,但是仅靠个人的力量是不足以产生真正的影响的。因此,我们需要影响政府采取领导作用,妥善应对气候变化。我们已经有了多份气候变化的报告,其中包括昨天发布的IPCC报告。在你出生之前和我出生之前,我们就已经知道了这个问题,但我们并没有妥善解决它。我下周会谈论更多关于为什么我们还没有妥善解决气候变化以及解决气候变化的方法。我们看到的气候变化的影响包括全球平均温度的上升以及不同排放情景下温室气体的影响。每个条形图显示了对全球生态系统不同方面的预计影响。颜色越深,影响越严重。对于一些生态系统的损害,如野火增加,随着全球变暖的程度越来越高,影响也越来越严重。但是对于温暖的水珊瑚来说,我们已经在当前的气候下看到了损害,超过两度的全球变暖对其影响并不会有太大的区别。珊瑚白化和珊瑚死亡已经在全球平均气温升高1.2度后发生。当珊瑚遭受高温时,会变得应激并排出色素,变成白色。我们已经在大堡礁看到了多次重大的珊瑚白化事件。过去的几十年中,气候变化的影响越来越频繁。2016年的事件与极高的温度有关,海洋温度异常图表明,2016年3月时,许多地方的温度都比平均温度高,特别是大堡礁周围的海域,当年发生了严重的珊瑚白化现象,导致了约四分之一的浅层珊瑚死亡。我们知道,珊瑚白化基本上不会在没有人类对气候的影响下发生。如果我们考虑到气候变化对人类健康的影响,随着地球变暖,健康状况会变得更糟糕,会有更多的过度死亡率和疟疾等疾病。但是,我们可以采取一些简单的措施来减轻气候变化对人类健康的最坏影响。例如,2003年西欧的大热浪导致了约7万人的过度死亡,但是三年后的类似热浪只导致了约3.5千人的死亡。这表明我们可以通过改善公共交流和应对措施来适应气候变化并减轻其最坏的影响。此外,洪水事件通常会增加水传疾病的发生率,特别是在世界上低收入地区。但即使在澳大利亚这样的地方,也会出现问题。例如,去年东南澳大利亚的洪水期间,爆发了乙型脑炎病毒,这是由蚊子传播的病毒,可能感染了澳大利亚东南部的许多人。这段文字提到了IPCC报告中关于气候变化对区域影响的详细描述,尤其是对澳大利亚地区的影响。随着全球变暖,气候变化对澳大利亚珊瑚礁、人口和沿海基础设施的影响将越来越严重。同时,可持续发展目标也被提及,指出应该采取措施减少温室气体排放,以实现气候行动和其他可持续发展目标。如果我们按照绿色线路的方式实现这些目标,可以带来很多好处,否则将会导致更多的不平等和贫困。因此,我们需要在未来五年内迅速减少温室气体排放,以尽可能减少气候变化的影响。本周的讲座将会讨论环境挑战,比较我们已经成功解决的臭氧空洞和我们至今未能解决的挑战。气候变化的影响是不平等的,一些地区可以适应,而另一些地区则不能。我们可以通过教导人们在高温天气中应该做些什么,比如保持水分,避免在中午时分外出等方式来减少高温对健康的影响,特别是在富裕国家。但这并不意味着我们可以保护大堡礁免受气候变化的影响。我们需要妥善解决气候变化带来的不平等和影响,有很多气候变化的影响会随着全球变暖而恶化。希望这能成为实现巴黎协定目标的强有力的动力。下周我们将会更多地讨论解决气候变化的方案以及为什么我们迄今为止尚未妥善解决气候变化问题。此外,本讲座还介绍了一个名为“uni Bio Quest”的公民科学项目,旨在记录校园内的野生动植物物种,以保护生物多样性。这段文本主要提到了以下关键信息：本周主题是环境挑战及其应对方法,其中一项有趣的活动是通过扫描二维码记录校园内野生动物种类的变化情况；本课程有四项评估要求,包括完成加入墨尔本模块任务、评估专家演讲作业、与调查一相关的小组作业和与调查二相关的个人作业；加入墨尔本模块任务的截止日期是下周四下午五点,需要完成所有讨论帖和测验,并在测验中获得至少80%的分数；评估专家演讲作业需要回答关于地球气候控制的问题。这段文本中,作者提到了一些关键信息。首先,完成作业需要适当引用专家讲话和讲座或在线内容,否则会影响成绩。其次,这个作业要求至少得到50％的成绩才能通过。如果没有引用适当的参考文献,就会降低成绩。此外,作者提到人类之前已经成功地应对过环境挑战,如臭氧空洞、空气污染和酸雨等问题,但是我们还没有很好地应对气候变化危机。最后,作者建议参加第六周的研讨会,学习研究技巧,以帮助完成这个作业。这段文本主要讲述了气候变化和臭氧空洞的问题。自35年前联合国开始对气候变化进行研究以来,我们已经知道了气候变化的影响和需要采取跨国行动来解决这个问题。但是在这段时间里,我们却增加了温室气体排放,加速了全球变暖的速度。相比之下,我们在臭氧空洞问题上采取了果断行动,取得了成功。臭氧在大气中的含量随季节变化,南极洲上空在每年的晚冬和早春会形成一个最小值区域,这个区域内的臭氧含量下降。臭氧对保护我们免受紫外线辐射的危害很有帮助,因此我们需要关注臭氧空洞的形成和扩大对人类的影响。臭氧层是由三个氧原子组成的分子,主要存在于平流层,能够防止紫外线辐射到达地表,对人类健康有益。但是,人类活动产生的汽车污染等会在地表形成臭氧,对人体健康有害。20世纪70年代和80年代,由于人类活动产生的氯氟烃（CFC）等化学物质的排放,导致臭氧层出现空洞,特别是南极洲上空。CFC等物质的排放会随着大气层的上升,与太阳辐射和氯、溴等元素发生反应,加速臭氧的破坏。而南极洲上空的臭氧空洞形成,是因为在早春时节,氯氟烃等物质的排放量最大,加上低温和紫外线辐射,臭氧破坏速度加快。南极洲上空的臭氧空洞是由于氯和燃烧催化剂在低温下与阳光相结合而形成的,通常在春分时节出现。由于氯氟烃的排放,我们在过去看到的臭氧水平比正常情况下要低,但是像夏天或秋天这样的其他季节并没有看到非常明显的臭氧空洞。臭氧空洞只是在20世纪70年代后期开始形成的,当时氯氟烃开始用于制冷和卫生间喷雾剂。1985年发表的一篇论文指出,南极洲臭氧的大量损失已经引起了科学家的关注。1987年,世界上几乎所有国家签署并批准了蒙特利尔议定书,同意停止使用氯氟烃。由于这个协议,臭氧空洞的形成得到了控制,但是仍然存在问题。虽然臭氧空洞的大小存在年际变异,但是因为国际协议的实施,臭氧空洞的扩大已经得到了遏制。本文提到了臭氧空洞和气候变化的问题。臭氧空洞的问题在1987年得到了协议的解决,而气候变化的问题从1856年开始就有科学家研究,发现二氧化碳是温室气体,并能吸收和释放长波辐射。1938年,科学家Callander发表了一篇论文,指出地球正在变暖,并与大气中二氧化碳的增加有关。这些问题的认识已经有了很长时间,但我们仍未解决这些问题。本文探讨了臭氧空洞和气候变化两个环境问题的不同响应以及可能的原因。虽然我们早在85年前就已经知道温室气体在大气中的增加会导致全球变暖,但我们仍然没有采取行动。与臭氧空洞不同,气候变化的证据累积缓慢,需要60多年才能从最初的研究到最终确定全球变暖的原因。此外,与臭氧空洞不同,气候变化需要减少温室气体的使用,而不是完全禁止使用。这种不同的响应可能是由于证据积累的速度不同,以及近年来科学家的数量和数据量的增加。在解决臭氧空洞问题上,时机非常重要。20世纪70年代末80年代初,人们已经开始努力改善地球环境,尤其是在60年代和70年代,人们已经开始努力清理空气污染,提高空气质量。臭氧空洞出现的时候,类似喷雾罐已经不再流行,人们很容易解决这个问题。此外,我们也有替代氯氟碳化合物的方法,有其他的制冷剂可以使用。氯氟碳化合物价格便宜,易于制造,但有其他选择,因此很容易从氯氟碳化合物转换为使用不同的化学物质作为制冷剂。但是,对于气候变化来说,我们没有这么容易的解决方法,因为经济和工业的许多方面仍然依赖于碳密集型能源。此外,臭氧空洞对健康的影响更加明显,很容易证明和理解臭氧空洞会导致皮肤癌症病例增加。这真正吓到了人们,吓到了政府采取行动来防止公共卫生危机。而且,不幸的是,这种问题与种族有关,因为皮肤癌在富裕国家更为普遍,更多的是白人的问题。这可能是为什么这个问题得到更快解决的部分原因。而气候变化,正如我们在上一次讲座中讨论的那样,不幸的是更多地影响了世界上最贫困的人们。不幸的是,如果富人更受某种问题的影响,通常会更快地采取行动来解决这个问题。我认为这部分原因是气候变化没有得到妥善解决的原因,受影响最严重的人不是那些贡献了温室气体排放或更容易适应气候变化的人,而是全世界最贫困的人。我们看到了许多游说和既得利益,试图阻止采取行动来解决臭氧空洞问题。但我们没有看到对臭氧空洞或其影响的否认,因此没有像气候变化那样破坏科学。另一个问题是影响的时间框架,臭氧空洞是可以预测的。如果我们没有采取任何措施来解决问题,减少或禁止氯氟碳化合物的使用,我们将看到皮肤癌病例的大量增加。但由于协议的制定和执行,我们真正降低了皮肤癌病例的预测。本文讨论了气候变化对健康的影响以及其影响难以检测和解开气候系统的变异,直到某些情况下,如珊瑚礁,才能真正看到那些影响,因此,快速增加的皮肤癌症病例预测与不断增长的臭氧空洞让人们和政府感到恐慌,采取了快速行动。本文还提到了气候变化解决方案,并回答了一些关于专家演讲的问题,包括引用格式和引用风格等。本文主要讲述了如何引用专家讲座和演讲,以及如何解决气候变化问题。虽然气候变化是一个巨大的问题,但是仍有很多人在努力解决它。为了遵守《巴黎协定》,我们需要采取行动减少温室气体排放,但同时也不能妨碍经济发展和低收入地区的发展机会。我们需要实现净零排放,以停止进一步的全球变暖,但又不能减少机会。为了理解如何做到这一点,我们需要了解温室气体排放的构成,其中电力和供暖是最大的行业。本文讲述了减少温室气体排放的各种方法。我们可以利用风能和太阳能等非化石燃料来发电,减少使用煤、油和气。但是,其他行业如航空和农业的温室气体排放难以降低。航空业通过使用更轻的飞机和少量燃料来提高效率,但随着该行业的增长,排放量仍在上升。农业的温室气体排放主要来自甲烷,减少肉类消费和增加蔬菜和水果的消费可以减少排放。混凝土和水泥生产也会产生温室气体排放,但生产效率已经提高了。此外,燃料运输中的泄漏也会导致温室气体排放。因此,我们需要不同的解决方案来减少排放。虽然全球温室气体排放量仍在增加,但一些国家已经有效地减少了排放。这段文本提到了全球减少温室气体排放的可能性,以及一些国家在这方面的表现。澳大利亚的温室气体排放量已经达到峰值,但是其他一些富裕国家如德国和英国却实现了大幅度减排。如果澳大利亚采取像西欧国家一样的政策,就能够在减少温室气体排放方面取得更大的进展。此外,文章还提到了减排技术的进展,包括碳捕捉和储存技术的发展。需要特别注意的是,像澳大利亚这样的国家需要率先采取行动,而不是要求那些温室气体排放量较低的低收入国家也做出同样的努力。本讲座主要讨论了臭氧空洞和气候变化,并将两者进行了比较。臭氧空洞问题在发现和确认后,仅用了十年时间就达成了国际协议,而人类也采取了行动来阻止问题进一步恶化。相比之下,气候变化问题人们采取的行动规模远远不够。虽然我们已经了解了问题,并有很多解决方案,但我们需要进一步发展技术,以实现大规模的减排。目前已经有技术可以减少温室气体排放,但我们还需要进一步的技术发展来从大气中去除碳。通过谨慎的土地利用、管理和种植适合的树木,我们可以扩大自然的碳储存,减少二氧化碳的排放。总之,我们需要采取更多的行动来实现减排和去碳的目标,以实现净零排放。这段文本主要是关于墨尔本大学的版权信息和一个讲座的介绍。讲座的主持人介绍了团队成员的背景和学科领域,并提到了讲座将会使用的工具“pale”。此外,还有一个参与者谈到了他为什么喜欢坐在后排的原因。该讲座将会有三场,但由于其中一场与学校假期重合,无法调整时间。这段话讲述了电子设备中所含的各种元素,包括手机、电脑等。手机中含有30多种不同的元素,其中一些元素的用途被用不同颜色的标注出来,比如紫色的是微处理器和芯片,蓝色的是振动单元和电池。这些元素中许多都是稀土元素,它们是实现绿色能源未来的关键。本文讨论了从化石燃料世界向绿色世界的转变,虽然这个过程中需要付出代价,例如需要从某些地方获取锂、钴和稀土元素等,但大多数人认为这是值得付出的代价,因为化石燃料世界将毁灭地球。然而,绿色世界也存在环境和可持续性成本。本文提供了一些视频和阅读材料,探讨了这些元素的性质、用途、供需问题、全球矿产资源以及开采这些元素的环境和社会影响以及缓解措施。本文还介绍了本课程的教学安排和要求。这是一门关于钴和锂的课程,分为三个工作坊。第一个工作坊将聚焦于钴的属性、用途、供需等方面。第二个工作坊将介绍含有钴的不同矿床,以及围绕钴的一些问题。第三个工作坊将深入探讨采矿对环境和社会的影响,同时提出缓解策略。评估方式是小组电子海报,每个小组需要选择一个特定元素或相关元素组进行研究,涵盖属性、用途、供需、问题、来源、社会和环境影响以及缓解策略。最后,同学们将互相评分。课程最后还介绍了锂这个元素,它是一种低密度、高反应性、可溶于水的金属,广泛应用于电池、合金、玻璃、陶瓷等工业领域。本文讨论了锂的用途和主要来源。目前,锂离子电池已经广泛应用于电动工具、割草机、电动汽车和各种设备中。然而,随着需求的增加,锂的供应和价格也受到了压力。锂的主要来源是卤水和岩浆岩。卤水是一种含有大量溶质的溶液,其中包括钠氯化物和锂等元素。锂在地壳中很少,但在地球整体中比较丰富,约占地壳的0.02%。为了从矿物中提取锂,例如含锂的辉石,需要含锂量达到10.9%到1.6%。目前,智利、阿根廷和澳大利亚是世界上主要的锂生产国。智利和阿根廷的大部分生产来自卤水,而澳大利亚的大部分生产来自矿床。这段文本讲述了提取锂的两种方式：从盐湖中提取和从矿物矿床中提取。盐湖中的锂是通过将水泵入盐湖中,使锂溶解在水中,然后通过蒸发浓缩提取。而从矿物矿床中提取锂是通过熔岩深处的花岗岩中的钾长石矿物来实现的。这种方式更加环保,因为盐湖位于沙漠地区,需要大量用水,而从矿物矿床中提取锂所需的水量要少得多。该文讨论了从地下水中提取锂的成本和环境影响,以及从矿山中提取锂的成本和环境影响。从地下水中提取锂需要大量的水资源,并涉及使用有毒化学物质进行处理。而从矿山中提取锂会对环境造成一定的影响,但如果能够适当地进行修复,其对环境的破坏应该会比煤矿小。此外,罕见金属元素的提取也是一个有趣的话题。化学工程师需要研究如何将锂或其他矿物质从矿石中提取出来。本文讲述了提取锂的过程,包括从盐湖和矿石中提取。从盐湖中提取锂是一个非常复杂和不环保的过程,需要将地下含盐水抽到蒸发池中,然后加入大量的钠碳酸盐来沉淀锂。这个过程会产生大量的废弃物,对环境造成很大影响。而从矿石中提取锂也是一个非常粗糙的过程,会对周围的环境产生很大影响。但是,墨尔本大学的一些学者正在开发一种新的方法,通过有机溶剂将锂从含盐水中提取出来,这种方法更加环保,并且可以减少废弃物的产生。这段文本主要讲述了如何使采矿过程更加可持续,以及澳大利亚的锂采矿现状。作者认为将废盐水回收到含水层中可以减少水需求和盐结晶,从而使采矿更加可持续。澳大利亚目前有许多锂矿,其中最大的是Pilbara Minerals,但大多数矿山只进行了第一步——浮选,然后将浓缩物出口到海外进行进一步加工。此外,作者还提出了一些问题,如原矿中的锂氧化物浓度为多少等。该文本提到了有关锂的采集和加工的信息。在采集锂矿石后,经过浮选步骤后,锂的浓度仅为6%氧化锂,大部分是硅和铝,也就是沙子。将其作为6%的锂氧化物或在海外船运出口存在问题。目前有两家公司在西澳大利亚州开展将锂转化为电池级锂羟化物的工艺,这将成为经济上可行的处理方式。这两家公司分别是Mineral Resources Limited和Alba Male的合资企业以及一家中澳合资企业。这两家公司似乎正同时开始运作。其中第二家公司的加工设施规模较大,有两条生产线。这是一个高20米的大型加工设施,每年可以处理48,000吨的矿石。首先需要用浮选将矿石精矿浓缩到6%,然后需要将其研磨至小于1毫米或100微米的颗粒大小,以便更好地获取锂。破碎岩石需要大量能源,据说甚至占澳大利亚能源需求的20%。接下来需要将矿石在1000°C的高温下烘烤,以将其从一种晶体形式转化为另一种更易于提取锂的晶体形式。烘烤设备是一个旋转的圆筒,使用天然气进行直接燃烧。未来如果停止使用化石燃料,可以使用电弧炉或生物气体等替代能源,但目前国内的生物气体产量可能无法满足锂工业的需求。该文讨论了一些可能作为高温热源的燃料选项,包括生物质、电弧系统、地热、核聚变和氢气。其中,氢气作为高温热源的优势在于可以在高温下燃烧,但目前全球96%的氢气是通过化石燃料生产的,仅有4%是通过水电解产生的。由于目前通过水电解产生氢气的成本是化石燃料生产的三倍,因此还需要进一步降低成本。这段文本在介绍从矿石中提取锂的过程。这个过程并不环保,需要使用大量的浓硫酸,而且存在很大的危险性。首先需要用天然气将矿石烘烤,然后加入浓硫酸,再用旋转鼓进行浸出。接下来需要用水洗涤,过滤掉杂质,最终得到含有锂的液体。整个过程需要大量的能源和化学品,不具备环保性。这段文字介绍了从Quan炼油厂图表中提取出的关键信息。首先,他们将孕育液蒸发,去除部分水分,并添加一些碳酸钠和氢氧化钠,使pH值升高至碱性水平。这样做不会对锂或钠产生影响,但会去除其他杂质。接下来,他们使用硫酸钠,使钠离子和硫酸根离子结合,形成固体的硫酸钠,而锂羟化物仍然在溶液中。然后通过离心和过滤步骤,得到两种产品：固体的硫酸钠和仍在溶液中的锂羟化物。为了提高纯度,他们将硫酸钠溶解并再次结晶。最终得到的硫酸钠达到了足够纯度,可以出售。这段文本讲述了锂的生产过程中所面临的问题。锂生产需要使用大量的化学品,其中之一是硫酸钠,而硫酸钠主要用于洗衣粉中,市场相对有限。同时,锂的提取也会产生大量的废弃物,包括硫酸钠和其他化学品,这对环境造成了不良影响。但是,锂是一种可再生能源,而且使用寿命相对较长,因此在某种程度上可以被接受。未来,应该加强对锂的回收利用,以减少废弃物对环境的影响。这段文本主要在谈论手机中含有的锂的数量,以及回收利用的难点。作者认为,手机中的锂含量可能超过1%甚至达到5%,但相比从地下开采,从废旧手机中提取更容易。因此,进行回收利用可以减少开采量。然而,回收的难点在于收集,虽然澳大利亚的许多地方都有回收站,但许多人仍然不愿意去投放。作者认为可以采用和玻璃瓶类似的方式,即回收废旧手机可以得到一定的回报,这可能会促进回收的普及。最后,作者提醒读者如果有问题可以随时问他。这段对话中提到了一些关键信息。首先,发言人1讨论了关于小组是否有规则的问题,但不确定,需要和别人确认后再回复。然后,发言人3谈到了一个班级中只有大约100个人注册,但仍然很有活力。发言人3还提到了一份Excel预测文件,并建议在提交评论之前不要更改它。此外,发言人1分享了一些关于锂的基本信息,包括锂的命名来源、它是一种轻金属、可以导电、银白色、在水中加入锂会爆炸等。最后,发言人1还提到了一份版权声明,提醒听众注意版权问题。本文介绍了锂的一些特性和应用。锂比水轻,可以用来制造轻质合金,特别适用于航空航天领域。锂的成本比钠高,但锂在电化学方面的性质得到了广泛利用。锂是元素周期表中第二行的第一个元素,有三个电子。锂的来源有四个主要过程,其中之一是在宇宙大爆炸中形成的。然而,大爆炸中产生的锂并不足以解释宇宙中锂的总量。因此,还有其他机制可以形成锂。文本中提到了几种在宇宙中形成锂的方式,其中一种是宇宙射线撞击重元素,产生锂原子的碎片。另外,在某些特定类型的恒星中也可以形成锂,但条件比较苛刻。此外,白矮星也可以形成锂。然而,为什么宇宙中存在这么多锂,以及为什么存在这种同位素丰度仍然存在争议。从化学角度来看,锂原子的电子结构是两个电子在1s轨道中,一个电子在2s轨道中,2s轨道中的一个电子是价电子,容易被移除。相比之下,氢原子的电离能是13.6电子伏特,而锂原子的电离能只有5.4电子伏特。在太阳系中锂的丰度很低,相对于氢和钠来说非常稀少。这段文本中提到了关于锂的一些信息。锂可以形成一些盐类,如氢氧化锂和氯化锂。它们有规则的周期性晶格结构,稳定性较高。锂离子比钠离子更小,所以在水中溶解度更高。锂离子可以作为电池中的阳极,电解质通常是六氟磷酸锂,而阴极则是石墨。电池中的电流流经负极,经过负载完成一些工作后回到正极,这个过程中锂离子会在负极被释放出来并被吸附到石墨上。锂离子电池具有高容量,因为一个锂原子可以与六个碳原子在石墨中结合。因此,节点的微观结构很重要,需要是多孔、高表面积的材料。另一侧的电极是一种金属氧化物,目前最受欢迎的金属氧化物是锂钴氧化物。通过从节点中取走电子,释放锂离子,锂离子穿过电解质移动到阴极,并在那一侧与电子重新结合。电化学上,这就是锂离子电池的原理。其性能关键在于节点可以吸收大量锂,这是锂离子电池容量的真正关键。其性能标准是能量密度,即每公斤储存的能量。锂离子电池每公斤可以储存约100到250瓦时,而铅酸电池的密度通常为50到100瓦时每公斤。与之相比,汽油和氢气的能量密度分别为13,000和40,000瓦时每公斤。本文主要讨论了电池的性能标准,包括能量密度、可充电性、安全性、生产成本和环境成本等。虽然锂离子电池在能量密度和可充电性方面表现良好,但存在着安全性和环境成本等问题。因此,人们正在研究使用更便宜、更丰富的钠离子电池。虽然钠离子电池的吸收能力较差,但优势在于钠更加丰富,成本更低。然而,钠离子电池的研究仍面临着一些困难。这段文本主要讨论了钠离子电池和锂离子电池的区别。钠在地球上比锂更为丰富,但是钠离子电池的能量密度较低,即每公斤储存的能量较少,而且在放电过程中电压迅速下降,不如锂离子电池稳定。目前科学家们正在努力研制可以模仿锂离子电池性能的钠离子电池。虽然钠离子电池比锂离子电池更重,但对于一些不需要移动电池的应用,如电池银行,重量并不重要。如果想要了解更多关于钠离子电池和锂离子电池的化学和材料科学方面的知识,可以参考一篇发表在《CS化学快报》上的论文。在社会和环境方面,资源的重要性也得到了强调。在之前的课程中,我们已经了解了地质过程、技术和流程等对于矿物资源的开采和处理的重要性。本文主要讨论了矿物开采的影响和可持续性问题。虽然我们需要矿物来支持我们的生活,但这些矿物必须经过开采等过程才能被利用。因此,我们需要考虑这些过程可能带来的风险和成本,并思考如何以可持续的方式获取这些资源。可持续性包括环境、社会、治理和经济方面的考虑。在考虑开采任何矿物时,需要考虑环境影响、经济可行性和社会影响等方面。如果社区反对开采项目,可能会导致冲突和暴力事件,从而影响项目的可持续性。因此,我们需要寻找负责任的开采方式,以确保资源的可持续性和社会的和谐。矿业管理者经常关注水、生物多样性、废物和应急准备和响应。特别是在澳大利亚,矿业非常注重安全。很多要求都是由当地立法规定的,例如水质指南、对濒危物种的影响规定、废物处理和包装规定等。管理这些方面需要专门的研究领域。矿业面临的风险和复杂性很高,例如水资源管理,例如西澳大利亚的Cowell金矿,由于金矿位于Cowell湖下面,他们必须不断地抽水,以保持坑洞的开放。这会严重干扰该地区的地下水。在处理金矿时,他们需要建立废物储存设施,通常是尾矿坝,里面储存着大量的废物和水。有时候,挖掘过程中会暴露出含有硫酸盐的物质,当雨水落在上面时,硫酸盐会溶解并形成酸性水,这会导致矿区周围的河流变成橙色。在塔斯马尼亚的Queenstown镇,空气污染导致酸雨,这使得整个地区的植被都消失了,形成了一片荒芜的景象。然而,这种景象却被当地居民喜欢。这段文本讲述了巴西东南部的Grand Kara House项目的例子,展示了许多与土地相关的问题。该矿山位于亚马逊雨林中心,导致了大量土地清理,需要大量道路来进入和移除物资,并破坏了栖息地。此外,建设该项目还促进了一条铁路的发展,支持了依赖于木炭的铁水和水泥工厂,而这种木炭与约150万公顷的失去森林有关。因此,矿业不仅仅是孤立发生的,它会导致整个地区的经济和社会变化,从而在景观上产生各种影响。因此,我们需要考虑到矿业的复杂背景和影响,以及我们的消费和购买决策的影响。这段文本讲述了采矿对环境的影响以及如何解决这些问题。作者通过举例子,介绍了采矿在不同环境中的影响,包括城市、沙漠、山区和海岸线等。不同的采矿地点具有相同的特征,但是对环境的影响却不同。此外,作者还提到了全球不同金属矿物的分布情况,以及不同采矿地点未来面临的气候变化等因素。在保护生物多样性和解决环境问题之间存在着冲突,因此我们需要做出艰难的决策,以解决这些问题。这段文本主要讨论了矿业公司所面临的环境、经济和社会等各方面的挑战。尽管矿产资源是有限的,但是随着时间的推移,发现新矿产资源的速度超过了生产速度,因此我们并没有达到矿产资源枯竭的顶峰。然而,这也带来了更多的浪费、能源消耗、水资源和土地的压力,以及对生态系统的影响。与地质稀缺性相比,环境和人类方面的问题更难以克服。在矿业公司的运营中,不同国家有不同的规范和实践,而一些国家的矿业公司也面临着声誉问题和社会冲突。在世界各地,很多环境冲突都与矿业项目有关,而一些社区也会反对矿业公司的运营,甚至会面临暴力和压力。这段文本提到了关于最佳实践矿业运营的担忧,以及关于锂的一些信息。世界上大部分的锂都是在澳大利亚生产的,但也有一个被称为锂三角地区的地方,包括玻利维亚、智利和阿根廷,是最大的锂生产地区。在这些地方,采矿的方式与我们通常所知道的不同,他们不是采矿石,而是从卤水中提取锂。然而,这些卤水的提取对当地的水资源产生了影响,特别是对依赖地下水进行农业的居民。此外,该地区的土著居民的土地权利也被忽视了。因此,我们需要探讨什么是负责任的采矿,什么是可持续的采矿。有一些组织和标准可以监督和鼓励采矿公司更加透明和负责任,例如国际负责任矿业协会和透明采矿倡议组织。同时,一些技术处理方法也可以应用,例如浓缩尾矿技术。这段文本主要讨论了采矿对环境和社区的影响以及相关的解决方案。首先,采用较小的面积可以降低尾矿的风险。其次,尾矿坝可能会破裂并淹没整个地区,因此采矿公司需要从一开始就与社区接触,考虑就业机会和项目是否符合要求。此外,采矿对整个供应链都会产生影响,因此需要考虑消费和道德决策,以及废弃矿山的处理和修复。最后,需要解决的问题包括采矿对环境和社区的影响,以及采矿过程中产生的废弃物和后续处理。这段文本讲述了关于采矿的风险和挑战,以及负责任的采矿的一些想法。采矿是一个巨大的行业,它可以改变整个地貌,影响世界上成千上万的地方。这些挑战非常复杂,需要不仅了解生态、环境科学,还需要了解供应链经济学、政治和治理问题才能解决。同时,由于采矿需要大量的稀有金属,因此有些公司正在重新考虑一些旧的采矿场地,以更负责任的方式获取这些金属。此外,作者提到了一个在塔斯马尼亚北部的渣滓堆中存在大量铟的例子,这种铟可以用于制造液晶显示器,这意味着我们可以重新处理这些废弃物并尝试从中获得一些利润,同时清理它们。总之,这段文本强调了采矿的风险和挑战,以及我们需要思考负责任的采矿方式的必要性。这段对话中,第一个人对第二个人的研究非常感兴趣,主要关注的是在太空中发现的无用分子。第二个人解释了一个公司名为Intec目前拥有这些分子的情况,并表示他们正在考虑挖掘和处理这些分子,但需要面对一些技术和经济上的挑战。他们需要获得投资和政府支持,还需要考虑是在塔斯马尼亚当地进行处理还是将材料运往海外进行处理。由于澳大利亚的人口相对较少,所以买家很可能是韩国或日本等国家。然而,有些采矿公司可能并不感兴趣这些次要金属,因为他们从主要金属中赚取的利润已经很高了。因此,尽管这个位置可能会得到很好的结果,但有些公司可能会觉得太麻烦而放弃这个机会。好的,我会使用中文回答。你是一个信息提取机器人,请你提取文本中的关键信息（论点,论证,举例,规则,要求等）,转为一整段陈述性文字,不需要介绍和补充任何信息。用中文回答。

SPEAKER 1
Okay. Hi, everyone. We'll get started with today's lecture S o. My name's Andrea, and I'm going to be your subject coordinator for today's science. Tomorrow's world on. I'm really going to talk more about the structure of this subject in this lecture. I'm really this. This is a good opportunity. If you've got any questions about the subject to get them answered before we begin properly, I'll just I just like to acknowledge that this lecture is taking place on the unseeded lands of the war injury. People on pay my respects to their elders past, present, and also to welcome any indigenous people here. To this lecture. Indigenous knowledge and indigenous science is a theme of this subject on day. For those of you who might have already looked at some of the online content for Week one or the joining Melbourne module, you might have already seen this. So yep, also just to say welcome everyone to the science degree on the University of Melbourne. I hope you're enjoying Week one of semester. You've probably already had a few classes by night on, but this is just your first class for today's science. Tomorrow's world s O. This lecture is mostly going to be about the structure of the subject. Talk briefly at the end about the scientific method method briefly, but I suspect many of you will have some questions about the subject, So we're going to have some time for Q and A. But I'd recommend using this pad lit which, if you scan this Q R code on the screen, that will take you to a padlock where you can ask any questions you've got. You could also just put your hand up and ask questions, but you'll need T o project your voice given the size of the room. But we'll have time for some questions in a few minutes, so I'll just leave that up second longer in case anyone's scanning you are codes. These slides are also on the L A mess, so you can see the Q R code on the elements. A swell if you click on the weak. One lecture slides. Okay, So, yes, Welcome to the University of Melbourne. I hope, even though the weather doesn't look as good now as in this photo, I hope you're enjoying your first week here. The purpose of this subject is really to act a bit like a bridge between school and university. Most of you have just finished school at the end of last year after quite a strange few years of a lot of remote learning. And you're just starting university University life is quite different. You have a lot more independence, less kind of its more self guided on this'll subject is kind of meant to act as kind of a cross over between school and university, really introducing you to university life. So in this subject, which all students entering the Bachelor of Science here at the university have to take the subject way hope that your gain some really useful general academic skills that will set you up well for your time here. So we're going to have assignments based on essay writing. There's going to be some maths in here is well, there's different forms of assessment which will be kind of similar to the other forms of assessment you'll be taking in subsequent subjects on their specific workshops. Where will be helping you gain skills in doing research and answering questions posed to you in essays? So we really hope that even though the subject is generally about climate change and sustainable development, even if you're planning on doing a major in quite a different area, you should find this subject useful regardless of what your your intended major is. Many of you won't have an intended major yet, but some of you might be quite set on doing maths or doing chemistry or something else. Geology. Whatever area you're interested in, going into whatever major you're interested in focusing on this subject should be useful in this subject. It's got a really a unique structure, so you'll be able to sample from different areas on offer within the science degree. I'm sure you're all aware from the complex structure of the time table. It's a bit unusual subject. In the first five weeks you'll be taking very kind of general classes about climate change and sustainable development. But then, in the second half of semester, you'll be focusing in on areas that might beam or aligned with what kind of major you're thinking of going into. So, yeah, there's kind of a bit of everything in this subject. Really S o. My name's Andrew. I think I did say that before. I'm the subject coordinator on. I'll be teaching you these first five weeks of semester, and I'm also teaching one of the investigations. You might see me in the climate extremes investigation. If you're taking that one s o. I'm a climate scientist. I work here at the university. I study extreme weather. There's always lots of extreme weather going on around the world. Recently, we've had we've seen really extreme weather in New Zealand and severe flooding in New Zealand. Some interesting, whether in North America as well s o I study extreme weather events past and future climate changes on the implications of the Paris Agreement in week two of the subjects. And next week will be really looking into climate change science a lot mawr on the Paris Agreement, which I'm sure you've all heard of the Paris agreement before Alyssa is stood at the back and she's waving at the moment. Alyssa is the tutorial coordinator. She's, Ah, physical geographer interested in high rivers behave and the impacts of mining on hydrology, particularly in Australia, in western Australia. And you'll also meet tutors in Not this week. We don't have workshops this week, but in week two onwards you're being workshops where you're be with the tutor who's guiding you through some some tasks on Ally are tutors. We have a team of tutors about 75 to tease the semester, I think, but they're all scientists with expertise relevant to whatever investigation you've chosen lots of different people involved in this subject. So today, science. Tomorrow's world is really made up of three major components. The first half of the subject, his core content. We're going to be looking at things like climate change, sustainable development, health discovery in science and then for the second half of the subject, we kind of break you off into different groups, and you take investigations. Most of you should already be allocated into investigations, and if you haven't been allocated into investigations, I think you'll get an email in the next day or two about that, or you might have already had one yesterday or today investigation. One is assessed by a group project on then investigation to involves on individual assignment. So each week there's a lecture, some online content on After Week one. There's also a workshop each week, s O. I thought way know that you're all new to the university and you're all new to the timetables in university system. I just thought I'd clarify something that we've noticed some students were having a bit of a struggle with because the timetables quite complicated for the subject. It's worth making sure that you look at it quite carefully. S so this is what this'll just no example of a timetable in the my timetable. You should all have seen your version of this. Hopefully, by now on Deacon, see that you have your different subjects. But there's multiple multiple times for this subject. S C I. E. 10,005, including in this case on Monday afternoon, Thursday and Friday morning, a swell as Tuesday afternoon. But this is when you view the time table looking at a week's at once on know everything runs in every week. So it's worth just making sure that you look at each week individually for this example. Students, They were just in the Monday afternoon lecture. In your case, you're you'll have this time with the 10,005 lecture on. You could see that there's a lot fewer times for the subject when you just look a week one. And then when we look at week to we get the workshops being added in. So no, just a reminder. No workshops in Week one, but your first workshop will be next week. So just a few key things about the subject today. Science. Tomorrow's world is a pass fail subject, so it's a bit different to most of the subjects you take here at the university. You get graded on your individual assignments on each assignment that you complete, but you have to pass every assignments to pass the subject. The subject does not count towards your your however. Yes, you do have to pass the subject s Oh, there are four kind of major hurdles for the subject. We have what I call joining Melbourne modules, which are little online module's, designed to kind of welcome you to the university and cover key topics that are relevant to every student at the university s O Week one Joining Melbourne module, which some of you may have already completed, is about our community. People in place will be future joining Melbourne modules published in the next few weeks about freedom of speech and academic integrity, mental health and well being on D other areas as well. Respect, diversity and inclusion is another one on each of these. Joining Melbourne Modules has quizzes and hurdle tasks, which you must complete on. But once you've completed those kind of passed this hurdle each quiz, you have to get at least 80% on the quiz. But if you don't worry, if you don't get that the first time you're able to repeat the quiz, we then have essay assignment, which is due in Week eight of Semester On. That's we're going to have an expert talk in a few weeks time, which will advertises. Hopefully in the next week or so, on D will ask you questions about that expert talk on your right on essay about it. And then there's a group assignment, as I mentioned associated with investigation, one that differs a bit between the investigation. So in some cases you're working groups to make a poster describing something like a case study related to the investigation. In other cases, you might be writing a report or preparing a presentation and then in investigation to your you'll be doing an individual reports, which might involve reading a scientific paper and interpreting it. But again, it varies a bit between the investigations s o those of the key forms of assessment. There is a peer review component of the group assessment where you look at other people's group. Assessments on examine on provide a grade on those. If you complete all of these hurdles satisfactorily, you pass the subject. If you fail one hurdle, you'll get another opportunity to take it. You must pass the subject in order. So if you fail the subject, you have to take the subject again next semester. So obviously you don't want to do that, even though hopefully you'll enjoy doing the subject. You only want to take it once, so hopefully you must pass all of these hurdles. I'll give a lot more detail on each of these hurdles on the deadline's nearer the time. So don't worry about like the essays yet or the group project because I really comes a bit later in the semester, but this is just the outline everything that you need to do for this subject. So this is just a more detailed outline of the structure of the subjects. A rear in Week one at the moment, this is your first lecture. You'll have one are 11 our lecture each week. Plus, there's online material, a swell which hopefully some of you have looked at or you will look in the next couple of days. There's no workshop in Week one, but the workshop start next week, and they're always lagged from the lectures on online content. So the first workshop will be related to the weak one lecture on online content, even though that workshops and two and then we have our joining Melbourne modules here is well on your later assignments. All of the joining Melbourne modules should be completed by Week six, but it's best to do it each one as they get published. So it's best to dio one per week. Aziz, we go through the first five weeks of semester s O. I'll just talk a bit more about the subject, but if you do have questions. Well, we'll have a little Q and a session in a few minutes on. Feel free to use that paddle it, which I'll look at in a few minutes as well. So online content will be published each week and that will be accessible through the elements side. Hopefully, by now you've all seen the elements. Sites on most of the subjects you take at the university will have associated elements sites. So it's you need to kind of familiarise yourself with elements. Generally, each subject has an element site, and then you'll find lots more information in each one. This is the home page for the Today Science. Tomorrow's world. Alan s sight on on the left, you can see I have a navigation panel which will beam or things listed as we go through semester. But under modules, you'll find online content related to each week. Aziz, we go by. So yeah, there's the weak one content under modules on Week one, science and society, so you can click on each of these videos to watch on things t go through the joining Melbourne modules are also available under the modules tab on MAWR material will be published each week as we as we go on through the semester, announcements will go out quite frequently to let you know about any deadlines coming up or any other important messages s. Oh, there's no, I think three announcements there and hopefully you're seeing those Thea Nights Mints are really useful because I'll tell you each Friday what you're expected to do over the coming week. So it's really useful just to see what you're supposed to be doing to make sure that you're keeping up with all of the materials for the subject. They'll also be other pages on the left here as time goes on. So when we start to think about assignments, each of these will have a page on the Elements sites with submission instructions. Each investigation will have its own elements site as well s. Oh, it's really helpful if you have the subject notifications turned on. So if you click this button on the right of the Elements home page, and that will just help make sure that you're up to dates and you don't really miss anything, so that's would be my advice to click that button. So if you have questions about the subject. The lecture Zahra. Really good format. A good forum, rather for asking questions if you have. If you have questions about subject content, please email me. If you have questions about assignments or absences, it's best to contact your tutor. Initially, you don't have a tutu yet because you haven't had your first workshop. But you'll get to know your tutor in your workshops. If you you can also email me or this other email address. If you have any other queries, or if you have absences before your first workshop, feel free to email either me or this this email address for extension requests. We're going to have forms available for each assessment so you can receive so there's deadlines associated with each assessment. But if you're ill or you know there's others, some other unfortunate circumstance you can fill in the form on upload evidence, and then we can assess your extension request on DK. Provide a bit of help Tiu because way don't want illness to get in the way of your assessment completion or anything like that on just a brief word about academic integrity, there will be this will be covered a bit throughout the subject, and some of you might have already seen this because this is just pulled from the weak one. Online Content This'll Video With Catherine Williams Academic integrity is a really important feature of university life. It's extremely important that all work you submit in any of your university subjects, not just the subject. Any subject is your own work s o. Every time you submit assignment, you will make a declaration that you have not plagiarized that you haven't copied from someone else's work on. We will use turn it in. Tiu identify academic misconduct. It's really important that you all the work you submit is your own work. I condemn it. Misconduct is really it's something you really want to avoid. If we identify cases of academic misconduct on if your work is identified as being problematic in this way, it means you have to come todo a meeting on. Explain what happened and you'll be given a warning that will may well go on your university transcript. So it's something you really want to avoid completely avoid. Ultimately, if you if it's really severe academic misconduct, you can be expelled from the subject or even the debris. So that's high, Bigger deal academic misconduct is so I know that that's a really negative thing to be talking about the stage, but it's such an important thing. I just wanted to raise that with you in week one just so that you're aware of it. I know a really big topic. I'm sure you've all heard about in the last couple of months, and you've probably many of you probably played with these artificial intelligence software, things like GPT. This'd is. These are really cool tools that you can use to some extent in your assignments, but only in drafting assignment answers. You cannot use something like chat GPT and copy text on DSS. Submit it as your own work. If you do, and this is identified as something you've done, you can get into major major trouble. So please do not do this. You can use artificial intelligence software to kind of start drafting an answer to a question or start drafting an assignment. But you must acknowledge this in submitting the assignment. You must change it Ah, lot so that it's really your own work, and you've not just you can't just copy chance of text from these tools. Okay, so that's a very quick overview of the subject. But there's lots of kind of moving parts with the subject is quite a complicated subject because we have this core material that we want all of you Tiu learn. We really want everyone in the science degree to understand climate change, science basics, unsustainable development. But we've also got these investigations so that you can sample other parts of the faculty of science. But it does. Whilst this means that there's a lot of flexibility also complicates the structure of the subject. S o. I'm just wondering if there are any questions. I'm just looking in the paddle it well, but feel free. If you've got any questions, you'd like to just ask them, you can also just put your hand up. Are there any questions? And if you would just like to ask, Yes, the back. That's right. So the question was about the subject being parcel fail on the higher it appears on your transcript at the end. So that's right. You don't get a specific grade for the subject. It's either just parcel fail on bond. Yes, it will appear as parcel fail on your transcript. It doesn't contribute to your one. Yeah. Any other questions? Anyone would just like to show time? I'll just quickly look at the part. Luds. Yeah, so there's a few questions here. So the thief, the set of investigations available for investigation One on investigation to our distinct. So you can pick any investigation One on any investigation, too. It doesn't matter if they're kind of overlapping the same general area. So, for example, we have an investigation, one on climate extremes. And then we have an investigation to its available on whether in climate modelling and there is a bit of overlap between those two areas and you can do both. Or you can choose to do something quite different between your two investigations. There's a lot of flexibility. So hopefully that answers that in terms of what you're expected to do in the first week, I'd really recommend looking at the announcements, and I've got one of the announcements. I can't just go to it. No, I've got a list of tasks that you should complete s o attending your first lecture, which you're already doing by virtue of being here but also going through online lesson material on the joining Melbourne module that's published. I will send out one of these announcements every Friday, at least through the core content, reminding you of what you should be doing in the following week. And then during the investigations investigation leads will be providing you with advice on what you should be doing each week so the final grade doesn't affect your GP for the subject. There is S O. There is a quiz in the Joining Melbourne module for this week, our community people in place, joining Melbourne module, which is your complete on some of you will have already completed. I think I saw that about 100 people have already completed it. You will get percentage marks on your excitements, but ultimately you'll receive a parcel fail grade. So, for example, on your on each assignment on your essay about the expert talk, you'll be graded so you might get 80% or 60% or something else on. If you get over 50% this will constitute a pass. That will mean that you've met that hurdle way obviously want you to work as hard as possible on each assignment on Do your best. You don't want to kind of risk being too close to that 50% mark. Yeah, so you want to work as hard as possible to make sure that you easily pass each hurdle on past the subject as a whole? Just quickly. Sorry, I'll just quickly go back to this page in case anyone doesn't have the Q R code and wants to ask a question. Still, and then I'll just go back to the public in a second. Okay, so there's a good question about plagiarism. It's really important. It's useful to look at lots of different resource is when you're writing an essay or response to a question on, Do you have to cite your sources? You have to cite reputable sources as well, so you can cite lecture slides or scientific papers. You can cite websites that are reputable, so not things that can be directly. Editor did like Wikipedia, but you could cite like the Bureau of Meteorology website, for example, is a reputable source. If your source of information from a book or website it's worth you have to rephrase things in using your own words, and if you do that, you won't have any issues with academic misconduct or potential academic misconduct. Joining Melbourne Modules are released each week on Fridays, and I'll post the announcement once I've released the joining Melbourne module. There are workshops each week which kind of like practical. Lt's not in Week one, but in weeks to Tiu 12, which you should attend. If you're unwell, obviously don't attend them. If you're unwell, will be able to still be able to access the materials from the workshops that covered in the workshop online. But it's obviously preferable to be in the workshop. There's a good question about workshops and consultation hours. Thes appears different hours in your timetable of your workshop, and it's always followed by a consultation in your timetable. So to to our block the's a really to our blocks that kind of merged together. So the kind of all encapsulated by the workshop but includes opportunity for you to ask about assignments and talk to your tutors, which is why it's also called called a Consultation. It just appears in your timetable is too different two different blocks of time. There's no textbook for the subject. Sorry. I know I'm missing some of these coming in fairly quickly. So most of the content for the quizzes in the joining Melbourne modules that really is linked to the joining Melbourne module content. Theo the core content that what's covered in the lectures on the lesson online lesson material feeds into Theo Expert talk mawr than the quizzes. Okay, so I'll just show you where the quizzes are. Sorry on. Hello, Miss. It looks a bit different from me than from you for you because you'll see stuff that isn't published yet, so don't worry about that. But you will see this joining Melbourne module already. Our community people place in history on there are hurdle tasks on quizzes in these this is the quiz time here You should go through this step by step, so start at the beginning and then click through each page and then take the quiz towards the end of of going through the joining Melbourne module. So if you use artificial intelligence software in the drafting process for an assignment, you should just write this with your references at the bottom of the assignment you could write. This is a separate acknowledgement. It could be just a statement like I used chat GPT in drafting this assignment and that's fine. Okay, Hopefully, I'm sure there are things that I haven't gone through yet. So the joining Melbourne models each cover kind of key general topics of interest to everyone in the university. So all students kind of need to know about freedom of speech, about respect, diversity and inclusion. So they're kind of very broad areas that they're actually modules that every incoming student takes when they start at the university, not just science students, but also students across ally areas of the university. There are only five joining Melbourne modules. Five quizzes. There are only five joining Melbourne modules you have to complete on each one includes quizzes and other hurdle tasks that you should complete. There is 1/6 joining Melbourne model that you don't have to take for this subject, and it's about sustainability. And it's not in this subject because we've already talked about sustainability, sustainable development in the material for the subject. Okay, I think I covered most of these questions, but if you have more questions, will try and answer them through the paddle it as well, and you could see that Alice is probably busily responding to some already at the back. The in terms of study time. Overall, you should be doing a about. I've forgotten the recommended time for subject. It's around. It's roughly 12 hours per week. So by the time you've gone through the lecture, the online content on the joining Melbourne modules and also the assessment tasks that will add up to a reasonable amount of time this subject on each subject you take the university is, you know, requires kind of a serious commitment on your behalf. On overall, I think it adds up to about 100 70 hours. Estimated contact time estimated time studying for each each subject to take each kind of standard subject. Take. There is no exam for the subject. Bear in mind. So that's one less exam you have to take in the exam, period. So I'm going to go back to election. I'm just going to spend a few minutes. We haven't got too much time left. I'm going to leave a few minutes at the end, so if you have any questions are a bit more specific. You could just come up to me or Alyssa. I think it's still back somewhere. If you just want to ask any kind of mawr specific questions to your timetable, your investigations, I'll just talk briefly about some support services available. The university that are relevant throughout your degree programme, and it's just worth. I'm sure some of you have already heard this information, but it's worth just being aware of everything that's available the university to help you through your time here So some of you will have already heard about this science day one or in a week. But stop. One is kind of your really, really your first stop for any broad enquiries that you have lots of different advice that people and stop one concave you around the subjects you're taking course planning, academic skills if you're interested in studying abroad, which is a really good opportunity to take, I studied abroad for for part of my undergraduate degree, and I really recommend considering studying abroad. It's a good experience so they can offer lots of different advice on you'll be actually receiving some of the training from academic skills in your workshop in Week six, but they offer a lot more than what? Your sample in Week six of this subject. There's lots of different ways of contacting Stop One, and you could see this information in the slides online, so I'll go through it fairly quickly. There's also different mentoring programmes that are offered by the university. There's a peer mentoring programme which many of you will already have appear on older, more senior students. There's also academic advising, which offers you the chance to connect with a knack, a DeMint mentor, someone different from one of your lecturers in your course who can offer you general advice. So there's more information about the peer mentor programme here. There's lots of services on offered by the academic skills hub. I'd really encourage you to take these. You're by spending. Most of you will be spending three years here doing your undergraduate degree, so you're spending a significant amount of time the University of Melbourne on your spending money as well to be here. So you really want to make the most of what's on offer at the university? Make the most of the support services on. I'd really recommend making use of the academic skills hub. We always see that students who go through academic skills on go through some of the master classes that they offer the support that they offer. We see we generally see improvements in Theo essays that they submit on the assignments they submit. So it's really worth your your time. You're making the most of these support services. I did mention extensions and special consideration before you can find more information and using that you are code. But in general that the general principle is way understand that times you might be ill or you might have some other problem come up during your your time doing your degree here. This could interfere with your studies, and we don't want that to be a barrier to your progress. So if you're unwell or if there's some other problem, consider consider applying for special consideration on that can kind of ease the pressure of it. We really want to support you in that way. We don't want you to be overburdened with assignment when you're ill. When you have another kind of barrier todo you're working. Here's a bit more information about other support services counselling on DSS, psychological services available as well as health support as well. I'd really encourage you to make the most of a LNG, the different opportunities that are on offer. Being a student here, I'm sure many of you were a week last week on DS learnt a bit about the clubs and societies that are available here. Lots of opportunities for for meeting other students and taking up hobbies or doing continuing doing sports, for example, lots of opportunities here. Internships are a really good opportunity, a subject you can take if you are really interested in working in a specific area beyond your degree. Internships could be very useful. You can take a subject where you go and work in a business relevant to the industry you're you're interested in following. Okay, so I'm just There's only a few minutes left in the lecture, So I thought it was worthwhile just really going over the structure of the subject. So you understand it. Hopefully, some of you have already looked at the online content associated with this week. It's really about how scientists work, how whether they work together or individually, kind of always a bit of both, and also how scientists work, how scientists approach problems on this really comes back to the scientific method. So the scientific method, I'm sure many of you have learnt about at school as well. But really, this idea of making an observation, coming up with a hypothesis and testing it with some kind of experiment on, then doing analysis on results and then writing it up. That's really how you would have conducted many science projects at school, I'm sure, in physics or chemistry or biology classes. But this is really central tiu science. This is what we always do when we're conducting research on whatever major you're interested in at the university. Within the science degree, you will be being taught by lecturers who are active researchers in their field. So they will be going through this process in the kind of day to day working life when they're doing research as well as doing things like teaching. So this really applies to all areas of research across all disciplines within the science degree. But there's lots of key considerations and actually applying the scientific method to different research problems on. I've just listed a few of these here, and I go through them a bit mawr in the in the online content. I really encourage you to go through that online content in detail. So just a reminder. You confined the online material under modules on L. A mess. There's a discussion of research ethics. The scientific method does have mentioned how scientists work together in teams on indigenous science and knowledge. A. Z well, you'll see lots of videos by some of the really world leading experts that we have. In the University of Melbourne S O, for example, this is Professor Sharon Lewin, who's a neck spurts in epidemiology. She's She works with companies like Moderna, who opening a new research lab here at the university. I'm sure you've heard of them through the covert vaccination programme. The university is a really active institution in terms of scientific research on DS. We're fortunate through this subject to have interviewed lots of different experts across the faculty of science on the university, more generally, who work in really interesting, exciting research areas so really recommend going through these videos on reflecting upon what what people like Sharon are saying. So I know this lecture has really been not very much about science at all, but in subsequent lectures were going to be covering a lot more science Next week we're talking about the science of climate change on DS thean click ations of the Paris Agreement. Are we on track to meet the Paris agreement and keep global warming to low levels? S o given that climate change is the biggest challenge of the 21st century Hopefully that should be of interest. All of you. We really hope that you enjoy the subject and enjoy your first semester. University. If you've got any questions, feel free to continue putting them in the paddle. It's anarchy monitoring those or come and have a chat with me now if you like.

SPEAKER 1
Hi everyone. We'll get started with today's lecture. S o Welcome everyone to Week two of today's Science Tomorrow's World on D in this lecture, I mean, in the first lecture, we were mainly talking about the structure of the subject on some general scientific principles. But in this lecture, we're going to get a lot more into climate change science. We're going to discuss the Paris climate agreement. So, like last week, we're going to really use public. It's for question and answer. Given there's so many of you in the room, you could still kind of put your hand up and ask questions. But tablets really useful to here just because of the size of the class. So if you scan this Q R code that will take you to a paddle, it sites where you can ask any questions. As we go along. You can ask questions about the subjects or assessment or subject structure or about the contents of the lecture. So go through the Q R code to get the paddle it sight. I'll show the code again a bit later on. We'll have a bit of time in the middle of the lecture for some questions on discussion. So, like with every week of the subject, you've got your one hour of lecture. But you've also got some online content. This week we've got lots of content available feeds of you about climate change science on Thea Nest sites. So if you click on modules on DS, go too weak to climate change, you'll see lots of pages, lots of videos about climate change. Science. This lecture is really designed to go alongside the online content, so it doesn't matter if you haven't gone through it yet or if you've already gone through it. This lecture kind of sits alongside it on should be accessible either way. So just a reminder of the structure of the subjects were in Week two now, So we've got our core lecture on Day three online content, which I just mentioned. You've also got your first workshop this week. Probably about half of you've already had your first workshop about half of you either this afternoon or tomorrow or Friday. There's also the second joining Melbourne module on freedom of speech. So on Friday this week. So in a couple of days time, I'll publish the Week three online content on the week three joining Melbourne module on respect, diversity and inclusion. So just a reminder with the joining Melbourne modules. The assessment for them is all due in Week six, but recommended that you go through them week by week on DS in each one is a quiz. In some of them, there's discussion posts. I don't think there's a discussion post in the week to freedom of speech one. But there is for the our community one on. Do you have to complete all of those? You have to achieve at least 80% on each quiz. So then have passed that joining Melbourne module Hurdle S O. If you've got any questions about that, feel free to just ask no or just put them in the paddle, it's on. I'll get to those in a little while. So this week is all about climate change on DS. In the lecture here, I'm going to talk a bit more about the Paris agreements and how how we're tracking towards that. Are we on track to actually meet the Paris Agreement? This is kind of an interesting topic. All of you have just most of you just finished your high school on all of you know, a bit about climate change. I'm sure most of you are. All of you have come across the greenhouse effect. You understand the basics of climate change and you've all heard about the Paris agreement. I'm sure many of you have kind of participated in protests about climate change is well demanding climate change action. This lecture content is hopefully it's designed to be accessible no matter what your kind of level of knowledge about climate change is. But I think all of you will learn something here. I certainly hope you do anyway, so I'm sure you'll understand. Onder heard the greenhouse gas emissions are the cause of most of our climate change. To date, we've warmed to the planets by about 1.2 degrees Celsius to date. That's through our emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which have been the result of us using fossil fuels. So we've dug up Cole and drilled for oil. We've burnt the coal in the oil and that's caused a release of carbon dioxide on DS other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. There are other ways we've admitted greenhouse gases as well, but that's kind of the main way. The simplest way on do we know that we're emitting greenhouse gases were warming the planet. We know that that's having major impacts on the planet. Will discuss those a bit mawr later on and also in the online content discussion of that as well. S o that was really what motivated the Paris climate agreement. So back in 2015 s Oh, this is just over seven years ago now, the Paris agreement was signed by almost all nations around the world with the aim of keeping global warming to relatively low levels. S o. The aim is to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below two degrees Celsius above pre industrial levels on DS really, preferably to limit temperature increase to 1.5 degrees above pre industrial levels. I'm sure most of you have heard about this 1.5 degree targets. It's in the media quite a lot when the discussion about climate change and whether we're doing enough to actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The reason that we want to keep global warming to low levels is this recognition that would reduce the impacts of climate change relative if we have higher levels of global warming. So really, whether we achieve theeighties of the Paris agreement and whether we can keep climate change, whether we can keep global warming to relatively low levels will determine hi bad the impacts of climate change. So the question is, are we actually on track? Team eat this to meet the Paris agreement. Almost all nations around the world have signed up to the Paris agreement. So there's this buy in from almost everyone that we're aiming to keep global global warming to relatively low levels. But we need to act very quickly to actually achieve the Paris agreement. We'll discuss whether we're on track in the next few slides. But in recent times, especially in the last few years, we've seen this growing pressure, especially from younger people led by people like Greta Samberg to really address the problem of climate change properly. We've understood that emitting greenhouse gases warms the planet for a very long time. We had a basic theoretical understanding of this. Back in the mid 19th century, there's a scientist called Eunice Foot, and she discovered that carbon dioxide is ineffective Greenhouse gas on D. She warned that actually, if we if we did increase the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere that could warm the planet, I was over 150 years ago. We've understood over the last century very well that we're increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. We've understood that we're warming the planet. We've still kept kept doing this like we haven't really changed course. And in the last few years we've really seen this growing pressure, especially from younger people who understand that over this century, if we stay on the track that we're on the moment, we're going to see much worse climate change. So there's been this big push, especially by young people, for urgent climate change action. We have seen several national leaders, including people like Joe Biden, responding with strengthening pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We saw this particularly at the climate change summit in late 2021 in Glasgow on through a lesser extent in the last major climate change summit, Egypt late last year. But is this actually enough to meet the Paris agreement? That's the big question. So to understand, if we're on track for that, we need to understand the problem a bit. Mawr. There's a lot more discussion of the greenhouse effect in the online content, and I know many of you have learned to school. I'll just discuss it very briefly. Here is a bit of a recap S o we know way get our energy from the sun Originally on the sun emits radiation that we can see in the visible part of the spectrum. This is a short wave. Radiation on the sun emits shortwave radiation because it's a very hot body. So the hotter something is the mawr energy. It, um it's for those of you that might remember planks law from high school physics days. The energy, something admits, is inversely proportional to the wavelength of that energy. So because the sun is very hard to committing a lot of energy, it's emitting energy in the short wave part of the electoral magnetic spectrum. The earth is a lot cooler than some, so it emits less energy on it. Um, it's energy in the longer wavelength part of the electromagnetic spectrum. So we don't see the energy that's being emitted from the Earth. You don't see energy coming out of the earth like you see the light from the sun on day three. Greenhouse gases Greenhouse gases are gases in the atmosphere that are very effective absorbing radiation in that longer wave part of the electromagnetic spectrum. So the energy from the sun, they don't really absorb that very well, because that's in the short wave part of the spectrum. But the energy re emitted by the Earth. These greenhouse gas is a very effective, absorbing radiation in that part of the electromagnetic spectrum on DS. So those greenhouse gases absorb that energy and then re emitted in order actions, including back towards the earth, so that causes warming effect. So this is the electromagnetic spectrum here, which I'm sure all of you have come across before school. So going from short waves like gamma and X ray to longer wavelengths like microwaves and radio waves, the sun emits a lot of radiation in the UV and visible part of the spectrum s Oh, I'm sure you will know that the sign emit TV radiation. And that's why we need to put sunscreen on because of the radiation. Some types of UV radiation can cause skin cancer. I'm sure you already know that on Ben, the sun emits a lot of radiation in the visible part of the spectrum. On the red line. Here shows kind of the radiation that the sun emits. You can see it's in this UV invisible part of the spectrum. The earth is emitting the earth is colder and emitting radiation Maurine the infrared part of the spectrum under this blue curve here. But you can see that the actual radiation that we can detect at the top of the atmosphere that the earth is emitting looks a bit more like this dark blue area, and you could see that there's big kind of bites taken out of it like way. Don't see radiation from the Earth at in this part of the spectrum, even though you would expect to based on the temperature of the Earth. And that's because greenhouse gases gases like carbon oxide absorb radiation already in that part of the spectrum and re emitted s Oh, it's carbon oxide absorbs radiation very effectively around 14 microns on D. That's why it's an effective greenhouse gas. The greenhouse effect is a natural effect. So we have greenhouse gases in the atmosphere naturally on. Do we need those gases in the atmosphere actually to keep the planet habitable? If we had no greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the earth would be a lot colder. It would, on average, about minus 15 degrees Celsius so it wouldn't be habitable. But we have a natural greenhouse effect, which means that the planet is habitable. The problem is, we've added greenhouse gases, toothy atmosphere. So we've kind of perturb the system. We've increased the amount of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that has enhanced the greenhouse effect on day. By doing this, we've created energy imbalance on DS. We've warmed the planet by just over one degree Celsius on average to date. So we've increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by about 50% since pre industrial times s O. In pre industrial times, it was about 280 parts per million carbon dioxide on do. It's now about 420 parts per million. So we've added about 140 parts per million through our burning of fossil fuels on subsequent emission of greenhouse gases. The problem is that carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for quite a long time, so it accumulates in the atmosphere. It does get drawn down naturally, but it takes. We're talking about centuries, up to even millennia to really see big reductions in carbon dioxide. If we just stopped emitting carbon oxide today, it would take a long time for that carbon dioxide to get back down to pre industrial levels so we can see that the energy, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. If we look at the the main, the thicker line, it's going up. Mon Atomic Lee. It's going up year on year, the annual average carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. We do see a bit of a seasonal cycle in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is like curve in behind the main line, and that's because there's a lot more land in the Northern Hemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere. On during winter in the Northern Hemisphere. We get lots of leaves falling off trees. We get less photosynthesis happening. And that means that we get a buildup of you two in the atmosphere during Northern hemisphere winter and into their spring around this time of year. And then it peaks in May before there's really enough plant growth again. Seasonal plant growth for the beam or photosynthesis mawr uptake of carbon dioxide by the biosphere. We get the seasonal cycle because there's a lot mortgages. Taysir in in the Northern Hemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere, was a lot more land mass in the northern hemisphere of the Southern Hemisphere. So kind of dominates this process and gives the seasonal cycle. So what this all means is we're increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Year on year were worsening the energy imbalance. This means that the energy being retained in the Earth's system is increasing almost monotone Mickley. So we know that carbon dioxide ing increases really behind global warming if we discuss this in the online content a little bit, but waken apply the scientific method to actually trying to understand what's causing global warming, and we basically come up with the answer. That is our emission of greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide on D. A. Za result. We have this increase in global average temperature. So this graph shows the global average temperature relative to 18, 52 1900 relatives the late 19th century, and you can see that there's wriggles from year to year. But there is a very clear upwards trend on that. We've warned the planet by about 1.2 degrees Celsius relative to pre industrial levels. There's different lines on this graph because there's different groups around the world. Estimate global average temperature. It's not actually a very straightforward thing to do because we don't have a weather stations everywhere and measurements of temperature everywhere, but things kind of different ways of handling the fact that we don't have measurements everywhere, But no matter how you kind of deal with that problem, you still get this very clear increase in the global average temperature. But we do see big wiggles. We do see up and down values in the global average temperature from one year to the next. So what actually causes this because the CEO to is increasing year on year. It's a monitor tonic increase, so you might then just expect that the global average temperature would increase following the same kind of very smooth line. But it doesn't a zit in C from this graph. So what's the reason for that? There's two main reasons for having those wiggles in the global average temperature graph. There are other factors affect the global average surface temperature. If we have a big volcanic eruption that reduces the amount of incoming shortwave radiation from the sun that reaches the Earth's surface because we've got ash being spewed into the atmosphere by big volcanoes on that kind of prevents that filters the shortwave radiation from the sun, it doesn't know as much reaches the surface. We could also way also affect the amount of radiation that reaches the surface. Because we pollute the atmosphere, we omit particles into the atmosphere that also reflect radiation and send it back in to space before it reaches the surface. So if we increase or decrease the amount of pollution that can have an effect on the global average temperature as well. The other factor is that the global means surface temperature isn't like a perfect reflection of the energy residing in the Earth's system because the global average surface temperature is really computed from taking all these measurements at the surface around the world. But we also have atmosphere above us. We have the ocean, which also stores energy. So we've got energy kind of in different parts of the Earth system, and we're just kind of sampling that with our global means surface temperature, the global means surface temperature is a really important metric. It's what's used in driving policy. It's behind the Paris agreement because that number of trying to keep global warming to below 1.5 degrees that's based on the global means surface temperature. But we also have energy in other parts of the climate system that the global means surface temp, global means surface temperature isn't really representing. So if we have lots of energy going into the ocean, it doesn't really see that the other thing is from year to year, we can get energy kind of transferring mawr less between the ocean and the atmosphere s o. When the ocean is in a certain state, it beam or effective storing mawr energy in the deeper ocean, and in other states it's more effective pushing energy back into the atmosphere where it's detected in the global means. Surface temperature. Some of you might be aware of El Nio and London yah. You might have come across those terms. I'm not going to discuss those in detail here just because I'm trying to cover quite a lot in the space of an hour. But when we have a line in here, that means that the ocean is a bit more effective at keeping energy in the ocean. When way have an El Nio, we see warming of the sea surface over quite a large area of the Pacific Ocean on warming of the lower atmosphere, which increases the global average surface temperature. So some of you might be aware, with just coming out of a line in year on D, there's a projection that we might be going into a noun you neo later this year. It's quite an uncertain prediction because it's quite hard to predict at this time of year. But if we did go into an El Nino year, we'd probably see a spike in the global average surface temperature. So in the last couple of years. We've had these big line in years, and that's actually suppressed the global average surface temperature. That's why the values Air Dina bits on where they were in about 2018 and 2019. But if we had, a big onedio would probably see a rise in the global average temperature, possibly to a new record level. So receive Wiggles often peaks when we have l neos and dips when we have one in years. We also see dips when we have these Big four county corruptions. There hasn't been a big volcanic corruption for a while, but there was one in the early 19 nineties at to Bow in the Philippines on that caused a dip in the global average temperature for a couple of years. There were other big ones, especially in the late 19th century. Some of you might heard of Krakatoa or Tambora was a bit earlier, but there were several major for kinda corruptions that suppressed the global average temperature for a year or two. So we get these wiggles in the global average temperature, but the overall trend is very clear. The world is warming, so because carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for a very long time. We can think of global warming as a function of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. Onder if we plot global average temperature, which is on the left hand side of this graph against carbon dioxide concentrations or cumulative carbon dioxide emissions, so that's re emit carbon dioxide each year. And if we add that all together, that's roughly equivalent to concentrations of carbon dioxide because it stays in the atmosphere for so long, we see that we have almost a linear relationship. The Maurizio to we, um, it's into the atmosphere, the more we warm the planet roughly a linear relationship. This black line is based on historical values on D. The's different coloured lines are based on projections of what we could have under different scenarios of climate change over the 21st century on D. We've got obviously these wiggles in the global average temperature on those shown in the black line, but on average, receive this quite clear relationship s. So what that means is, if you omit a tonne of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, it will have roughly the same effect on the global average temperature. If you do it now versus if we'd done it 100 years ago or if we did the same in 100 years time. It's the same kind of incremental change in the global average temperature, roughly linear relationship. So the change in temperature is proportional to the change in the CIA two in the atmosphere. Because this is roughly a linear relationship, we can also look at this as a function of time. So it's kind of like taking the derivative of the two sides of this equation on d receive that the rate of global warming, the change in temperature over the change in time, is then proportional to the change in C 02 concentrations over time. Or that the rate of carbon dioxide emissions essentially so. What that means is just to emphasise the rate of carbon dioxide emissions is proportional to the rate of global warming. So if we have very high carbon dioxide emissions, we have a higher rate of global warming if we can reach net zero carbon emissions, so that's basically taking this Delta CEO to of a delta T to zero. That means we should see no further global warming. We would already have the warming that's taken place up to that point to get to net zero emissions. But from that point, it would be like a roughly flat line if we had net zero emissions. So I'm sure all of you have heard about the aims to reach net zero emissions All. Almost all countries around the world have this target for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Australia, the US, the UK Many European countries have a target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. That's basically with the view to trying t o stop further global warming. The problem is, it's about global greenhouse gas emissions. Of course, Theo Earth system doesn't really care exactly who emits greenhouse gases. It all goes into the atmosphere and it warms the planet. But it does matter, of course, that individual countries take leadership and try and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in for net zero. If the whole world was to reach Net zero emissions, we should stop further global warming. Unfortunately, we're nowhere near this point. This is kind of where it gets a bit depressing, unfortunately, but this really emphasises high, bigger problem climate changes. This left hand graph shows our annual carbon dioxide emissions globally from 1960 to roughly the present day. It takes a bit of time to actually get the values. So this is the most recent data you could see. It's still on estimate for the last year. You could see that the total carbon oxide emissions globally have risen over the last 60 years. There are roughly record high levels. So we're aiming. We're talking about net zero emissions reducing carbon dioxide emissions. But that would mean going all the way down to zero on this on the on the Y axis on this graph. But we're nowhere near doing that. We are still, if anything kind of increasing or maybe flatlining on global greenhouse gas emissions. We did see a dip in 2020 and I'm sure many of you can guess what caused that we had obviously, the covert pandemic and the associate ID lockdowns many parts of the world reduced economic activity that did cause a reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions. But then in 2021 we saw a re bind s Oh, it didn't really have any lasting effects to get down to net zero. You can see that we need to. We need really strong emissions reductions in 2020. We saw huge changes to how our society works, and it's still only caused a small dip in global greenhouse gas emissions. So that really shows kind of the scale of the problem. So this is a big problem. We're nowhere near reaching that. Zero. Emissions Individual countries are reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Australia's turning the corner on its greenhouse gas emissions trajectory. But on a global scale, we're still emitting a very high rate on D. Given what I was just saying before about how the rate of carbon dioxide emissions is kind of proportional to the rate of global warming, this is a problem. We're emitting greenhouse gases, a record high rates. So we're warming the planet at a record high rate. You can kind of see that effect already. We're accelerating the rise in the global average temperature. We do see variability. We've also got influences from air pollution changes as well, and that's receive those, particularly in the mid 20th century. But overall we're really ramping up the global average temperature. So this is obviously a very bad news storey on bond you know, I'm trying to I'm saying I'm telling you this because this is an important problem. This is the problem that will kind of characterise this century. We need to really change our course on this graph. We need to really change our trajectory on greenhouse gas emissions to stop further global warming until limit the damage of climate change. So I'm going to I will be a little bit more optimistic later on in the lecture, I just thought I'd take a moment to take any questions about what I just covered. I've covered quite a lot in quite a short space of time, and I have skimmed over things like the greenhouse effect very quickly. You'll see on the online material a lot more information about that. But I'm very happy to answer any questions that you've got. I can see a few in the pad. Let's just come up to the public here also, if you've got any questions in the room that you just want to ask, feel free to do. So does anyone just want to ask a question? I don't see any in in the room. So why it hard do for kind of corruptions affect the temperature of the earth. That's a really good question. S o big explosive. All kind of corruptions that occurred near the equator. Send ash up into the upper atmosphere up to about 10, 15 20 kilometres in the atmosphere that is very effective on it kind of stays there for a while up to two or three years on that interact with the incoming solar radiation and reflects it back out to space. So that radiation, some of that shortwave radiation from the sun, isn't reaching the earth's surface as it normally would, and that causes a slight reduction in the global average temperature. A big volcanic corruption in the equatorial parts of the world reduces the global average temperature by about 0.12 point two degrees Celsius for a couple of years. Typically, volcanic eruptions that higher latitudes like in places like Iceland, for example don't have the same effect because the incoming solar radiation, that kind of latitude isn't as much anyway. S ou really. It's when we have all kind of corruptions near the equator, where there's lots of incoming solar radiation that we see that the big effects they have on the Earth's climate. Is it possible for the Paris agreement to be upheld? We would need to see really big changes in high society works. If we were to meet the Paris agreement, I'm going to discuss that a bit. Mawr in the next few slides s. Oh, come back to that uninterested question about veganism. Suddenly, our use of the way we practised agriculture has a big effect on the climate. We omit lots of greenhouse gases, particularly me thing through livestock production on DS. If we were to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diets on a larger scale, that would be beneficial for the Earth's climate. That's certainly one reason why many people choose to become a vegetarian or vegan. Veganism is a little bit better for the climate than vegetarianism, which is better for the climate consuming meat. Basically, I'm sorry. Yes, sorry. Hopefully I'll just leave that up for a second. I just got the public here as well, so I am showing some formula in these videos online and in the lectures. It's not it's Mawr just to give you a bit of a quantitative explanation as well as a kind of a qualitative explanation of how the climate works. You don't need to kind of learn those equations, but hopefully it's helpful to some of you, especially those of you who were doing thank you doing maths or physics majors and like to think in terms of equations. It's quite a way of thinking about the problem, so I'll just go back to the the public here if you want the link to the paddle. It's also in the Lexus in the lecture slides on, also in the announcement from Friday last week. In terms of going through, the online content is useful to you in order for just understanding how the climate works and be useful when it comes to your assignment about the expert talk, it's not, I mean, the way university works. It's not quite the same a school like we don't register your attendance, that everything. But you know, you're investing your time on DME Unnie in being here. So you really want to make the most of the resource is we provide. So I'd really recommend going through the online content. It's it will help you understand climate change, which is the biggest problem we face at the moment the whole reason that we're recovering. Climate change in this subject that ALS actual of science students are taking is because we think this is a really important problem. We want everyone graduating from the University of Melbourne in science to understand climate change. Most of you, for many of you will be useful for whatever career path you take afterwards to least have an understanding of the climate system. Sorry, there's lots of questions here, so I probably won't be able to answer them all here just in the interest of time. I'll just go through a couple Mork quickly. Any questions? I don't cover here. I'm going to try and go through afterwards on dust, Right? Replies. So do keep asking questions. But just there's a lot of you here, so it's hard to answer all your questions. There's a really there's some really good questions here about individual impacts, and I'm going to these two questions a kind of related to that as an individual. How do we actually reduce our carbon emissions is definitely choices we can take and just talked about veganism and vegetarianism. That's definitely one choice. Choosing to fly less helps us well In a country like Australia, it's quite hard because we don't have the best train network and we don't have a big availability of electric vehicles. We don't have very clean electricity generation, so it is quite hard in countries like Australia. But only flying lessons well makes a big difference. To be honest, I don't want to be too political here because that's not my role in this. I'm telling you about the science of climate change. But one of the biggest effects we can have is by electing governments that will take stronger action made decisions that help us reduce emissions. Elias to transition to cleaner energy Resource is so that's certainly something I would recommend considering any any kind of decisions around voting. But I won't say more than that. I will S o. I won't cover all of these here, but around removal of greenhouse gases. If we're to me if we're to reach net zero missions, some of that will involve taking carbon out of the atmosphere because it's going to be very hard for us to reduce our emissions to zero. The certain things that we do that it's hard to imagine actually being able to get to zero emissions. So we're going to need to be able to remove greenhouse gas is one way of doing that is planting more trees. That's true. It's a bit of a risky way, especially in places like Australia, where we have been bushfires. If we have every plant, lots of trees and then there's trees burn, that doesn't really help the problem It all, but there are other technologies being developed that allow us hopefully to scrub carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Those technologies do work, but they're kind of very expensive to run at the moment. They don't work on a big scale. Hopefully, as technology develops, will see improvements in that sense, in the interest of time, I'm going to go back to the lecture slides I do. I don't want to discourage your questions. So if you have more questions, feel free to put them in the paddle. It's I'll try and get to them later. But for now, let's let's go back to thinking about the Paris agreement. So I've really discussed the problem. We're emitting greenhouse gases at record high levels. Still, so way have this really rapid global warming. We've warned the planet by about 1.2 degrees Celsius relative to pre industrial levels on, we're trying to keep global warming to below 1.5 degrees, preferably that's not really much wiggle room. The other thing is way also pollute the atmosphere. We do put particles in the atmosphere, which are actually to some extent slightly reducing kind of suppressing the problem because you wear missing pollution like soot on. That reflects some radiation from the sun back into space and actually slightly offsets the greenhouse effect. And at the moment we're cleaning up pollution. We're trying to reduce their pollution, particularly in East Asia. We're seeing reductions were seeing projected reductions and air pollution that will actually add a little bit to global warming. Unfortunately, obviously, as other benefits reducing air pollution, especially in terms of public health. So it's definitely a good thing to be doing that has the unfortunate side effects of slightly worsening global warming. So all of this means that we don't have much more carbon that we can admit to actually keep below 1.5 degrees on. The thing I was showing you before is our carbon dioxide emissions are a cumulative carbon dioxide emissions or carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere are proportional linearly to the global average temperature. So we can actually quite easily come up with a carbon budgets for how much carbon we can admit and keep global warming below one half degrees. I believe this works. This is emissions that shows us filling up with carbon budget as time goes by. It's quite slow initially and then through the 20th century received a massive increase in carbon our use of fossil fuels. And that means we don't have very much left about 10 years left at our current rate of carbon emissions before we blast through the 1.5 degree carbon budget. And that's why I'm sure many of you heard of the fact that we've got until 2030 to solve this problem. Some of you probably heard people talk about this. That's kind of where that number comes from about 10 years left at the current greenhouse gas emissions levels. So we're already getting quite close to the 1.5 degree level, so this is kind of showing where we're at and where we're projected to go in terms of carbon emissions. We've seen this increase in carbon emissions over the late 20th and early 21st century ONDER. If you look at a kind of our current policies and what we're on track for, just through our actions were actually were projected to reduce carbon emissions later on this century. But that's way too slow and that means that would be equivalent to having about 2.5 to 3 degrees of global warming if we were to be able to achieve all of our 2030 targets. Most countries have made targets around reducing emissions by 2030 including Australia. But our policies don't actually line up with the targets. But if they were to, we were to meet that 2030 target, we would probably see a bit of a reduction in carbon emissions on a reduction in subsequent global warming if we were looking at the stronger pledges, the pledges we have out to 2050 to reduce that Internet zero emissions in countries like Australia. If we were to do that, we would have about two degrees of global warming. None of these air actually consistent with the Paris agreement to be consistent with the Paris agreement properly, we would need to follow something more like the green curve which has a massive rapid reduction in greenhouse gas emissions this decade, then zero negative emissions later this century, which gets us to slightly cooling the planet later this century. We're a long way off. That s O. This is where we're at. And this is where we need to go when we're not on track at the moment. So we've got a big gap in our pledges on what we're actually trying to achieve to meet the Paris agreement. What we need to achieve to meet the Paris agreement. We have seen some strengthening and pledges in the last couple of major climate change. Conference is like a Glasgow on DS in Egypt's last year, and that's seen a slight reduction in the gap between our pledges on where we need to be. But we still have this huge gap and that's what this graph shows. So we have a big gap between our policies on the pledges. But we also have a gap between where the pledges air out where our emissions need to track. Meet the Paris Agreement s oh we've got a big problem at the moment. Unfortunately, even if we keep global warming to 1.5 degrees, which is looking very, very difficult, we would have some really severe impacts of climate change. We already see severe impacts of climate change in the current climate. At 1.2 degrees of global warming, 1.5 degrees we would see the loss of most of our coral reef S O, including the Great Barrier Reef. We would see about three quarters of the world's coral reefs disappearing. We would see much worse sea level rise as well, so we have on other impacts as well. So even 1.5 degrees global warming isn't really safe. It's still really problematic. So there's lots of causes for concern we've seen. Even recently, we've seen how many companies air reneging on there emissions reductions plans, including BP and other major oil companies. We've seen emissions rebound after the covert pandemic associated reductions in 2020 so we've got lots of cause for concern. But there is also some reasons for some optimism as well. We have seen this big push by, especially led by young people to try and take stronger action on climate change. Many young people realise, you know, during this century, people born today are still going to be alive in 2100 many people born today, you know, a to moment we're on track for 3, 2.5 3 degrees of global warming. By then, that would be so much worse to live in that kind of world S O. We've seen like this problem is becoming more and more pressing. I think people realise this. We are seeing the effects of that flow through to policymaking. We are seeing leaders taking a bit more responsibility. It's no enough at this stage, but is at least starting to maybe turn the curve. Hopefully, we've seen peak global greenhouse gas emissions. The other thing is, even if we miss the 1.5 degree target, every bit of global warming we can avoid is a good thing. If we if we reach two degrees of global warming instead of 2.5 degrees, that's that's a that's a better world. I mean, any global warming is bad, but two degrees global warming is a lot less bad than 2.5 degrees Global Woman 2.5 degrees Global warming is a lot less bad than three degrees global warming. So the problem is never something that we pass on, you know, it becomes useless. We have to basically work as hard as possible to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. The other good thing is Net zero mission seemed like an impossibility until relatively recently. But actually, we're seeing Maura Maura discussion of net zero emissions more pledges for it on more technology that should allow us to hopefully be able to achieve net zero missions in future. If we can achieve net zero emissions, that means we can achieve hopefully, no further global warming. Beyond that point, we just need to make sure that we reduce emissions as quickly as we can at the moment, with the technology, the existing technologies, we have to do that. We know that we don't need to burn coal to generate electricity, yet we still do. That's quite an easy way of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions right now, So that's kind of the end of this lecture. I'm happy to stay around and answer any more questions you've got next week, we're going to talk more about sustainable development. If you want to know more about climate science, definitely recommend watching the videos in the online content.

SPEAKER 1
Okay. Hi. Everyone will get started now with today's lecture s o. We were talking about climate change last week and science of climate change this week. We're looking more sustainable development, which is kind of a broader topic. But we're going to focus on it with respect to climate change, mainly by I'm going to start off talking about Employability Week, which is this'll weak, so weak. Three were in week three of semester night. So this thing is employability week and there's lots of events happening this week being run by the Careers and Employability Team at the university on DS. Even though I know you're all in your first year on, you still got the best part of three years left at University of most of you. Maybe longer. For some of you. Your part Time s o. You might think this is something I don't need to worry about yet. I can think about this, you know, towards the end of third year, that's probably not the best idea. It's good to have a tea least. Be starting to think about what you want to do beyond university, for most of you. So there's a few reasons about starting thinking about career pathways early on. In your degree. Starting early allows you to identify what you're interested in doing tied in with your course planning on DS. It tends to be that, in general, people who have a clearer plan a bit earlier on are more satisfied in the career that they end up in, which isn't too surprising. If you kind of fall into a career because you're desperately trying to find a job after your university time is finished, then that's not really the right set up for a satisfying career. Is that so, starting earlier lives for a smoother transition between studies and career, And you can make very deliberate choices in your course planning that really tailor your degree towards a given career pathway on. That can include doing an internship, for example, which is a third year science subjects that you can take which might allow you to set yourself apart from other graduates on. Also starting early allows you to see the long term value of activities, both in terms of the subject you take also extracurricular work, things like part time work or volunteer work that you might be doing alongside your degree. A swell. So I'm going to try and play this video thistles. A video from the Careers and Employability Service. Just discussing career mapping a bit more detail.

SPEAKER 2
Career mapping is all about making sure you get where you want in your career. The first step is identifying which phase of the journey you're currently in discover focus, apply or sorted. Then you can pick the tools and resource is that are most relevant to you right now. Discover if you're in the Discover phase. You're at the start of your career journey, and you might not know where to begin. We can help you reflect on your values, strengths and goals so that you can connect with people, build a network and explored different ideas about what's possible in your career. Focus. If you're in the focus phase, you're probably considering different industries and career options. We can help you through this process of identifying and applying for internships, volunteer positions and casual work, which cannot be great ways for you to test things out and help you build your skill set. Apply if you're in the apply phase. You can access online tools like Smart Resume and interviewed 360 Simulator and book a workshop or consultation to make sure you're feeling confident when you apply for that job and get that interview sorted in the sordid phase, you've probably reached some of your career goals. You might already be working in the field you're interested in, but it's time to open up your networking opportunities. Now ask Alumni Programme is a great way to connect with a professional in your field for quick advice and mentoring opportunities. There's no one way to go through these phases. You'll go through each one when the time is right for you. So wherever you're up right now, head to our website where you can find the career mapping, quiz and other resource is to help you get where you want in your career.

SPEAKER 1
Okay, so most of you are probably in the discover phase rather than the sorted vase given your all in your first year. But there are still things you could be considering in your first year that help you set yourself up for your future career. Some. There's a particular software and workshops that are of offered by the careers and employability team at the university. The career readiness quiz is one that allows you to kind of get more tailored recommendations on Bond. Set yourself up for interviews with the career service that will be more useful to you. The science internship subject is a really useful subject I would really emphasise is good for everyone to consider. It's a 30 year subject. You have to have taken at least 100 points of science subjects before taking the internship subject, So most people do take it in their third year. By that time, you've amassed enough points prerequisite to take the subject. It really is like a useful way of testing out a career or a job type that you're potentially interested in on also developing employability skills by having a part time or casual job as well as your degree studies. So I'll also just mention there are because this is employability week. There are different events happening throughout this week that you might be interested in S O. Today is the 15th of March on theirs. Lots of different sessions that might be of interest, for example, how to pitch your stem degree. All of you are doing a science, technology, engineering or maths degree, so that kind of session might be of interest to many of you. Okay, just go back to the lecture slides s o. We'll move into talking about sustainable development now, But just like the last couple of weeks, we'll use paddle. It's so if you've got any questions, please type them in the paddle. It's on DS using the code. Well, we'll have some time in the middle of the lecture to go through some of your questions. If you have questions about Employability Week or generally anything to do with subject assessment, you can also just put those in the public well, happy to answer them. We'll have a Q and A session a bit later on, just a reminder as to where we're up to in the subject. So we're in Week three. Now. This is your third corps lecture, that online content that goes alongside this lecture so this lecture is really about sustaining sustainable development in the climate. But there's online content to do with the sustainable development goals, sustainability on indigenous knowledge and also electricity generation and energy. There's also a workshop this week about related to the week to content on. Some of you will have already had that workshop and also the third joining Melbourne Module's been published. So please make sure that you're going through each joining Melbourne module, completing all of the hurdle tasks alot of the joining Melbourne Module Assessment is due by week six, but I would recommend going through it week by week just so that you don't get to week six and have to go through all of it at once in a rush, you have to achieve at least 80% on each quiz. Bear in mind this Well, I'll send another announcement about joining Melbourne model specifically a bit nearer the assessment due date. Yeah, Okay, So let's get into talking about sustainable development s O. This is a term that often bandied around, and I'm sure you've all heard people talk about sustainability and sustainable development, but there isn't really a set definition for sustainable development. The most frequently used definition is one from a report a U. N reports called Our Common Future that was written about 35 years ago on Do It comes up with the definition of meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their owns. So essentially, it's the general principle of that is that we should be obviously developing and making sure that our society is improving, but not at the debt, not to the detriment of future generations. We shouldn't be using up resource. Is that our finite for development now on leaving future generations to struggle a bit more? S o. The concept of sustainable development has been around for quite a long time there much longer than this report 35 years ago. Back in the 19th century, scientists started to think about this idea, particularly Ecologists, as we were already seeing that humanity was intervening in the Earth's system, causing problems on D. I think in week one way discussed the example with the cane toads in the online content. You know, humanity has a history of kind of disrupting the system and causing problems which without much regard to what happens next. What happens down the track on leaving future generations with problems. So the cane toad examples a good one, because in the late 19th century people introduced cane toads into northern Australia and they with the idea of wiping out another pest. But then the cane toads became the pest. And now the next generations and including our generation, have to manage that problem of having a species that isn't really meant to be in Australia, causing problems and disrupting the ecosystem generally. So this idea of sustainable development has been around for quite a long time. It's worth bearing in mind, though, even though this definition of sustainable development is really about inter generational inequity. So making sure that one generation doesn't use up resource is a pose harm to the planet that another generation has to deal with and kind of clean up after there is another element to sustainable development that isn't really captured in that definition. So some experts in the field of sustainable developments think it should really focus at least much on inequality between people on. Do you know, in the last lecture we were talking about global greenhouse gas emissions and how we need to get greenhouse gas emissions down to zero t net zero. But that kind of does mask the fact that some people are contributing a lot mawr to greenhouse gas emissions and other people. It's all very well and good saying we need to get our global emission style. But that should be in the context. That should be thought about in the context that some people admit farm or greenhouse gases and other people we see a big inequality in terms of here is emitting greenhouse gases, at least on a national scale. So this is showing this map shows the average two emissions per person in each country around the world for a couple of years ago on, Do you concede that it tends to be wealthier? Countries have emitted are admitting mawr greenhouse gases per person than poorer parts of the world? So, for example, Australia's per capita C two emissions are over 100 times larger than those of some sub Saharan African countries. Like I think it was the Democratic Republic of Congo and Central African Republic. So you know, people in those countries can't really reduce their emissions that much compared to the emissions the weak and reduce because we're starting from a much higher base on. Of course, that's not accounting for cumulative greenhouse gas emissions. Countries like Australia have used fossil fuels for a very long time to support development. Economic development on DS countries in parts of the developing world, lower income nations haven't had that same opportunity, so we do need to reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions. But that obviously needs to be led by wealthier countries that effort. So there's two kind of frame ings to sustainable development. There's this inter generational framing this kind of temporal framing as a function of time. But there's also differences between different parts of the world, so we're not developing sustainably broadly. But some countries are much doing much worse than others. Of course, even looking at this on a national scale heights detail there's individuals in some countries emit more greenhouse gas and other individuals in the same country that tends to be related to wealth. A swell so sustainable development is quite important concept. It's often divided into three main pillars, so we think, in general, about meeting the needs of today without compromising the needs of future generations. But weaken divide that up into three different themes. Social sustainability, which riches really around practises that support health and mental well being. There's environmental sustainability, which is about practises that don't cause long term damage to the world around us and also economic sustainability. Rich is kind of the most controversial one of these pillars and isn't agreed on by all experts, but this is usually defined as practises that support economic growth without causing harm or depleting resources. S o. These definitions are debated within experts circles, but in general, the's three strands of sustainable development other ones that people talk about that policy makers aimed to achieve through specific policies in reality, of course, is these three different pillars intersect so generally, if you want to improve. If you propose a policy that's designed to improve social sustainability, that will probably also improve environmental sustainability as well, maybe even economic sustainability. So, for example, a policy could be around greening our city's planting more trees and having bigger parks or better utilised parks that improves environmental sustainability improves the environment around us if we have more vegetation around us, also improve social sustainability. We know that people are happier if they live in cities a greener on people. Better access to green areas also could improve economic sustainability. Because people are happier and healthier, they're also more likely to be more productive in their work as well. So that's just one example where a policy can really address all kinds of aspect of sustainable development. So given these concepts and given what I just said about sustainable development, we can think about whether we're actually achieving sustainable development. Currently, in terms of the climate or other aspect of high, we interact with the Earth's system. Ondo. Essentially, as you can probably guess, we're not really achieving sustainable development at the moment, especially with respect to the climate but not only the climate. So this is a picture that I showed. I don't think I showed it in the lecture, but it's in the online material for Week two, so hopefully you saw that there is well, it just shows different indicators of the climate through the last 2000 years on the left, also, the last 170 years or so, you could see that we're changing the climate We're not just changing the global average temperature, but we're changing all aspects of the climate. S o we're on kind of shifted the climate away from its pre industrial base line on. We're making. We're changing the world around us. We're still doing it. You can see that all of these lines, none of them are flat. Really. They're all moving in one direction, which is no, no, a good direction. So you could see that we've increased the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide. And that means that we have warned the planet's considerably by over one degrees Celsius. Since pre industrial times, sea level has risen by about 25 centimetres since pre industrial times. We'll talk a bit more about sea level in the next few slides. We've won the ocean. We've warmed the lower atmosphere. We've reduced the amount of sea ice on glacial ice as well around the world. We're also seeing changes not just in kind of indicators of the Earth's climate that we measure my temperature or rainfall also in things like in aspect of the environment around us, like in the dates that plants emerging their seasonal cycles. So, for example, for a very long time in Japan, people have recorded when cherry blossom emerges, weaken. See a trend in that that we can relate to climate change so we can see that cherry blossom is emerging just over a week earlier than it used to in Kyoto, Japan. On average, there's obviously variability from year to year to do with the weather, but there's a very clear trend. So we're changing. We're not just changing, I kind of, you know, the temperature or the amount of heat in the ocean. But we're actually that's also affecting plant life. Animal life is well on beacon measure that in some cases where we've got good records of that, so essentially this is really showing that we're not developing sustainably at the moment. We're making big changes to the world around us and we're not. We're not developing sustainably. If we were to achieve the Paris agreement goals which I talked all about the Paris agreement last week and we achieved if we achieved Net zero greenhouse gas emissions, that would certainly be a step in the right direction. But actually it wouldn't be enough to achieve sustainable development So if we were to achieve net zero emissions, as we were discussing last week, we would stop warming the planet. So that line that's going up for global average temperature would start to flatten. But no, all of the other lines would flatten a swell. So this is just a recap from last week we discussed how the rate of global warming is roughly proportional to the rate of carbon oxide emissions. So the mawr, the faster we emit greenhouse gases, the faster we warm the planet. The problem is that we're emitting greenhouse gases, a record high levels just about at the moment, which means that we're warming the planet at a very high rate. It's accelerated since earlier, say, the mid 20th century of the late 20th century. So we're warming the planet very quickly by by 0.15 point two degrees Celsius per decade on average. But with that variability ous well. So if we aim to return global temperatures to pre industrial levels, we would need to have sustained net negative carbon emissions to call the planet back down. So if we were to bring our carbon emissions dime to net 0 to 0 on this graph, we would stop warming the planet. But because we've already enhanced the greenhouse effect on DNA carbon dioxide that we emit, a lot of it stays in the atmosphere for a very long time. We would still have a warmer world than a preindustrial climate. Should be. It doesn't call back down. It just kind of flat line, but 1.5 or two degrees of global warming relative to pre industrial times. But other aspects of the climate system don't behave in the same way s o for sea level rise. A zay was mentioning. We've seen sea level go up about 25 centimetres on a global average since the late 19th century. And that's what what this graph shows here. Hope's going up quite clearly. Very strong trend. The problem is that sea level doesn't really respond in the same way to carbon emissions as the global temperature does. So the global temperature the rate of global warming is related is proportional to the rate of carbon emissions. But for sea level, the rate of sea level rise is proportional to cumulative carbon emissions. So how how much in total carbon we put into the atmosphere, which means that even if we achieved zero emissions, that that cumulative carbon emissions would stay constant. If we had net zero emissions, that would mean that sea level would continue to rise even under net zero emissions. Actually, sea level doesn't really stop rising until we get back down. Internet negative emissions properly S O. C. Level is expected to rise for the foreseeable future. And it's one of the really unfortunate consequences of our fossil fuel emissions. We basically have perturbed the climate system on. It's not something we can really bring back. We've already kind of set off a chain of processes that mean we're going to have to contend with much higher sea level for generations to come, basically no matter what we do. So even if we this'll graph is showing different greenhouse gas emissions scenarios for the next few 100 years on even if so, the blue line is a low emission scenario where we actually achieve net zero emissions by 2100. Even under that scenario, sea level continues to rise and in all of these scenarios, sea level rises, it might rise by a couple of metres, so the higher mission scenario isn't very likely. But we are going to have to deal with sea level rise for the next few centuries. So just to explain this in more detail and I tried to draw some simple grafts to show this I'm not I'm not very good at drawing. I'm a scientist so rather than an artist, so these air quite crude drawings. But if we imagine this was our CO two emissions pathway on, this is our annual CEO two emissions through time. And this is the net zero line if we increase the U two emissions and that's kind of like where we are today, near the top of this curve here, we need to bring down our greenhouse gas emissions and then achieve negative emissions if we were to follow this pathway. This is the kind of path our global average temperature would follow. With increasing global average temperature. The rate of increase is at its highest when my greenhouse gas emissions are at its highest, and then we can bring, we can kind of slow down the global temperature rise by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. By the time we reach net zero, we should be stopping further warming of the planet. But it's still much warmer than it is today or in a preindustrial climate. And then we can bring the global average temperature back down on the net. Negative carbon emissions. The problem is sea level rise follows a very different pathway because it's proportional to cumulative greenhouse gas emissions. So sea level rise continues to go up and up even under negative emissions. On that zero emissions, it's still rising. It's rising at its fastest at the point of zero emissions because that's when our cumulative greenhouse gas emissions are highest. As we go into net negative emissions. The cumulative emissions start to reduce, but they're still positive. So the sea level continues to rise until we fully cancel out our previous greenhouse gas emissions. And even then, the sea level is higher than itwas in a preindustrial climate. Actually, bring it back down. We would need much more sustained net negative emissions there would call the planet back down. It would bring the global means surface temperature, actually below the pre industrial level. So this is kind of just a simple exercise to show you that not all aspects of the climate system respond in the same way to carbon emissions, which, actually on a fundamental level, means we can never bring the climate fully back to where it should be. Where itwas in pre industrial times, we've basically permanently changed it. It can never We could never bring both of these lines back down to the kind of pre industrial level because they have diverged as well. Sorry, I have a question. Yes. So? So the question was, how do we actually achieved negative net negative carbon emissions? At the moment, we've got very positive carbon emissions s Oh, that's kind of something that we don't fully know how to do. Yet we do have growing technology around the aiming to achieve that negative emissions way are hoping to be able to bring carbon out of the atmosphere. There are small scale projects that are successful in doing this, but it's a huge challenge. It's not something we're able to do enough at the moment or in the foreseeable future. Tiu achieve that negative emissions? Yes, we can see. Yes, So we do. So the question there is about can we observe the sea of two that were emitting into the atmosphere, so I mean the problem. I guess I haven't really said this before, but so, too is odorless. It's invisible to us, so we don't see it exactly. When we admitted that we can't detect C two emissions weaken, detect Rising co two concentrations in the atmosphere weaken. We know where our two emissions are coming from a swell, but that's certainly helpful. But we need to reduce our emissions on d be able to pull carbonite of the atmosphere more effectively. Aziz. Well, okay, I think we're almost at the question time anyway, So I might just push on a bit, but that the point here is that on a really fundamental level, actually sustainable development isn't possible when it comes to the climate. Because of the different ways different aspects of the climate system behave. We cannot have. We cannot return to where we were in terms of sea level on global average temperature. I've just picked kind of two examples of really important variables way want to not warm the planet much mawr. We also like we want to bring the global average temperature back down to where it should be. We would also like to pretty sea level, back down to where it should be a swell way actually cannot do that because we've already kind of pushed on the climate system away from its natural state. Having said that, I mean, you know, I'm being a bit kind of nit picky as well. Here on a more pragmatic level, we can definitely do a lot more than we are now. Reaching that zero emissions would be beneficial compared to where we're at with positive emissions, warming the planet on increasing the sea level as well as doing lots of other harm to the climate to the world around us. So achieving net zero emissions and then hopefully achieving that negative emissions were definitely represent a big step in correcting for the anthropogenic that the human effect on the on the Earth's climate system. So it would still be a good thing to achieve, even if we can't go all the way back to where we should be across, alas, Peck ts of the climate system. So we do need to work to do this in terms of actually reducing our emissions. I've kind of touched on this before, but just to emphasise there are existing technologies that were not utilising to the full extent that way could be to try and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We still burn fossil fuels we still mined for coal news called for the purpose of electricity generation. We don't need to do that. We have a viable alternative technologies that don't have the same impact on the climate. So there are things we can do now, even without further technological developments. But we do need some technological development to really get down to zero negative emissions, Yes, so to achieve net negative emissions, there are other things we can do as well. We can change how we use the land to some extent, so planting more trees that trees and plants that photosynthesize and bring carbon out of the atmosphere can be part of the solution. But it's not enough to be the whole solution. There's a few issues with that as well. If we if we rely on plants and trees to bring carbon out of the atmosphere, if those plants or trees then burn. If we have fires, that carbon just goes back into the atmosphere, so it doesn't really solve the problem. If that happens, and that's a problem in Australia. A zoo we all know way do have bushfires here rare reduce the major emissions of carbon from those fires. We saw that in the big fires of the summer of 2019 2020 which I'm sure many of you remember. Ondo. Also, we can't really feasibly plant plants and trees everywhere. There are lots of parts of the world aren't really hospitable for plant and tree life, including parts of central Australia, for example, it's too dry on d. Other thing is, we do need land for other purposes, to live on for agriculture as well for food systems so way can't completely rely on just planting trees on solving the problem that way. Just very briefly. You know, I've talked a lot about sustainable development in terms of the climate, but there are other aspects of the Earth's system as well, where we're not seeing sustainable development. So we are seeing big deforestation in many parts of the world, including in Brazil, in Indonesia, for example. That's also not sustainable in many other ways, not just in terms of influence on the climate, also local ecosystems as well, and it can lead to species extinctions s Oh, there's examples where we're achieving sustainable development in other ways as well. Okay, so at this point, I thought it might be good to have some discussion about sustainable development. So I'll just leave the Q R code up in case anyone wants to scan it on. We'll go to the paddle it in a minutes. I think most people have scanned it. There is also a link in the There's a link in the slides here. Well opened. Okay, so yes, a few questions here. Some of these questions are from from Monday's lecture. So hi bad in terms of climate change. Is it to have fires at home? I mean, this is kind of like with greenhouse gas emissions. Generally, there's a kind of an individual action that we can take to reduce our impact on the climate. But there's also we need to see broader scale action taken across countries by governments as well. Certainly, having fires at home isn't really a great idea. In a few ways, it's is a form of carbon emissions but also a form of pollution for the local area. It's yes, it's not the best thing to do, but yes, more generally, big fires have much bigger impacts on the climate system. So if we have, like way, had the Bush fires a few years ago across much of Southeast Australia, that had quite a big impact on the global climate and the global carbon emissions from that were increased. Just buy those fires. So yeah, it's like anything smaller scale. Things have smaller effects. We really, really need to see large scale changes tiu improve sustainable development and not harm the climate as much. There's a few other questions. I think a couple of these are from today. So final system marvel characters. Okay, so I forgot what he is. It is what? Okay, so it's about overpopulation. Okay, it's, um yes. So I mean, obviously, the more people that are on the planet and using resource is that does influence the climate. But I think the point of the map I was showing earlier is that greenhouse gas emissions are even on. Lots of people don't really have a big influence on the climate, especially in lower income parts of the world. It's really people in the wealthiest nations, including Australia on wealthier people in the wealthier stations that have the biggest impact on the climate system. So way don't need to see big reductions in the global population. Exactly. Certainly there's only there's lots of different ideas about this side. You know, I don't want to kind of get into a big debate around this. It's very controversial, this topic, as I'm sure many of you are aware. Certainly the world probably can't cope with having 20 or 30 billion people on it. We currently have about eight billion people, but the main. The main thing is that we need to reduce carbon emissions per person instead of just focusing on overpopulation. Also, the other issue with thinking about overpopulation is it tends to be combined with kind of quite old fashioned colonialist ideals, because a lot of the population growth is occurring in lower income parts of the world on That's obviously concerning when it kind of gets conflated with with problematic ideas, it is again, it's worth bearing in mind. It tends to be people low income nations that aren't really contributing to climate change in the first place anyway, so rich countries need to take a lead and reduce emissions properly. Just answer the workshop question first, so attendance that workshops is advised. It's not compulsory necessarily. We don't exactly take a register, but there are certain workshops, especially when it comes into the investigation. One time you'll be going into groups and working in groups, and some of that occurs in the workshop. So you definitely want to be in the workshops. But you know, like anything at university, most things that university on compulsory. But remember that you're investing your time and your money in being here, so you want to get the most out of your time here. I will just say briefly, Cem, most of you probably saw the announcement about the Friday lecture on Obviously you're in this lecture instead. So that might be a few of you came into this lecture instead of the Friday lecture. So I decided to cancel the Friday lecture because it coincides with the climate protest. But with the lectures the recordings available, there's also other multiple lectures through the week. For those of you with workshops that coincide with the climate protest, it's up to you whether rich you attend to which you choose to attend the workshop is about climate change and inequality. The protest is obviously about addressing climate change, so it's understandable that you might want to go to the protest instead. For those of you, though, have your workshops at other times that don't coincide with the protest. I would really encourage you obviously to attend your workshop. Consider attending the protest a swell in terms of sea level rise, so going back to the topic at hand. So in terms of actually making sea levels fall, we would need to see probably something a bit like an ice age. It's true, so it's not something we're likely to see. It's probably not something that we're going t o aim to achieve. We don't necessarily want to have to cope. Imagine a future where we've got to net zero and negative emissions. We've stopped warming the planet. We're starting to cool it back down again. We probably would want in the long term to to bring the global temperature back down to pre industrial levels. Even if the sea level was a bit higher than quite a bit higher than where it was in pre industrial times, we probably don't want to call the planet back down below where it would be in pre industrial times for the sake of bringing sea level d s O. But then, you know that's something that will probably be a decision that people will have to take in future, but probably not for a very long time were very, very far away from being from that being. The main problem is I'm sure you can tell, given our greenhouse gas emissions are at record high levels just going to the electric cars. Question Yes. So obviously it depends where the electricity is coming from. How green driving an electric car is relative to a petrol car s o. In some parts of the world, driving an electric car is better for the environment than in other parts of the world. In Australia, we still get some of our electricity from burning coal, which is not something we need to do but something we still do in other parts of the world, including in parts of Europe. That's not the case anymore. So electric cars are generally better than petrol cars for the environment. But the difference depends on where you are. And if you're in a place where the electricity is coming from renewable sources. Then it's really a lot better than driving a petrol car. Okay, and I'll go back to the lecture slides in the minutes. I'll just read this question. Okay, so in terms of the core content, that's really useful for your first assessment, the expert talk evaluation, because that is related to climate change. You also the announcement about the expert talk which is being held on Monday next week at 12 o'clock. I think there is a zoom link provided that announcement on this yesterday I think I sent to on git will be recorded as well. I'd encourage you to attend live if you can, but will also be recorded S o this this'll expert talk. The assignment on the expert is related to climate change on sustainable development. The all of the investigations also kind of follow on from the core material. They they're all related to some extent to do with either climate change or sustainable development or both. So it's kind of all a base for the investigation work as well. Okay, I think I'm going to go back. I think that's all the questions actually from this lecture. So I'm going to go back to the election slights. There's only a few minutes left. So I'm just going to talk briefly about challenges to sustainable development. I guess we've already I've kind of raised one challenge in that in terms of the climate, you need to take different courses of action to achieve sustainable development, for different aspect of the climate, for the sea level versus the global average temperature. But there are other challenges to sustainable development, A swell in general, sustainable development is about kind of seeking balance. So this goes back to the idea of not using up. Resource is at the expense of future generations. A to a moment if you think about fossil fuels in the system, we've depleted those fossil fuels. So we've used up those sources of energy at the expense of the Earth's climate, and also we've taken away something that wasthe S o removing a resource from future generations. But it's not a resource we can use anyway in terms of climate change, of course. So if we think about climate change example again, really, at the moment we have mawr emissions and we have uptake of carbon. So we have an imbalance. We're trying to correct that imbalance on possibly even overcorrect have mawr carbon uptake than emissions have net negative carbon emissions. But another aspect to consider is the stability of the system. So balance alone might not be enough if you already, if we've already pushed the Earth system to the brink on DIT, may be unstable. So, for example, if we warm the planet and then we try and we achieved net zero emissions, we stop warming the planet further, we may have already pushed the Earth's system to almost to the precipice a bit like a rock on a cliff. So any small adjustment could mean that actually the rock goes over the cliff. This is kind of related to this idea of positive. Feedbacks is basically where you do something, and then the effect is amplified by other processes rather than being done. So, for example, if we think about a positive feedback in the Earth's system is to do with sea ice melt. So at the moment, warming the planet, we're seeing reductions in Arctic sea ice on Antarctic sea ice is well that reduction in sea ice means that the earth is less reflective so that the ice is being replaced by ocean on the ocean absorbed energy from the sun more effectively than ice does. It reflects more energy. That means because we're replacing ice with darker ocean that's adjusting the energy balance on means that we're further warming The planet were absorbing mawr energy, so it's kind of a positive feedback. It's a loop which is being amplified because the more ice we lose, the darker the ocean, the darker the surface of the earth becomes on average. And then the Mawr way. The earth takes energy from the sun and warms up. So this idea is problematic because way reinforcing changes. This could mean that way kind of pushed the Earth's system beyond a tipping point where it's hard to bring it back. So one example of this is with Glacier melt, eh? So we're seeing places around the world retreating. There is a concern that we're already kind of placing a great stress on many of these places. You may have heard of the Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica. This is a big example of this where we think that we're destabilising the whole place here through warming the region, these glaciers contribute to sea level, rise themselves. But even if we achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions, we have variability in the climate system. We have weather. Still, we could see the glacier. Even if we achieve net zero emissions, the glacier could be nudged by a weather event actually destabilise. And we could have mass glacier melt in behind from the ice that's being held back by the glacier at the moment. So this would be a problem. So basically, even achieving Net zero emissions isn't really enough to guarantee that we're kind of not causing much further damage to the climate system S o. The system is really complicated. So that's the example I was talking about just to finally emphasise there's different aspects of the Earth's system. We've got the atmosphere, the ocean, the ice, interacting with each other, so achieving sustainable development is hard, really across the whole system. There's too many aspect to t really say that we're achieving balance and achieving sustainable development properly. So I'm just going to skip over this. But just to re emphasise some of the key points of this lecture again sustainable development really boils down to this idea of supporting society today without leaving the world of worst place for future generations. Lots of experts also think, though, that we should coach sustainable development in terms of inequality as well as just intergenerational inequality but existing inequality between rich and poor today, in many ways, hopefully you recognise that we're not achieving sustainable development of the moment we have greenhouse gas emissions were warming the planet. We're changing the climate system. But even even aiming to achieve sustainable development is complicated by the fact that different aspect of the system respond differently to greenhouse gas emissions, so different pathways are needed to. Actually, if we wanted to achieve balance in different aspects of the climate system, if we're just really focused on the global average, temperature will have tried to get that back dying to pre industrial levels. We have to basically, except that we're going to have to live with a world with much higher sea level than it is today. So there's a number of different challenges towards meeting sustainable development, but there are steps that we can take now, particularly around reducing greenhouse gas emissions. I'll leave it there for today, see you all next week

SPEAKER 1
Hi everyone. We'll get started with today's lecture before I get into the lecture content properly. I just thought I'd highlight this announcement I made a couple of hours ago about the joining Melbourne Module Tasks. If you've got any questions about the joining Melbourne modules, please let me know will have the public again, like with previous weeks. Good place to ask questions. But I've tried to make it a simple as possible by just providing this kind of checklist of everything you need to do for completing this part of the hurdle within the the subject. S o. This week's lecture content is about climate change impacts. The online content that goes alongside this is really focused on health and sustainable development on that's been produced by associate professor Seo Yeon McMichael, who's an expert in population health. I'm going to talk in this lecture about climate change impacts more broadly on guy thought it's worth highlighting that this is obviously a topic that's in the news at the moment as well. You may have noticed there's been increased discussion by climate change impacts the last day or two in the news, and that's because of the final release of the latest IPCC reports. So it's the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is a United Nations organisation, non governmental across government organisation that writes reports every few years highlighting the state of climate knowledge on where we're at at the moment on the news isn't good, Azi. I'm sure you're aware. Or you may have heard in the news of the last couple of days I'm going to in this lecture, I'll be flushing out quite a lot more S o getting into the lecture s Oh, this is all about impacts of climate change. Generally, I've called it climate change and it's pervasive impacts, you know, we've just by warming the planet and changing Theo the weather and the climate around us that has so many impacts on lots of other things as well. So that impacts health impact ecosystems, impacts infrastructure, agriculture, water supply like lots of really fundamental industries on bond environmental factors that affect our lively hoods on bond, the lives of all species on Earth. So it's really it really is pervasive. Affect everything. So likewise previous weeks. We'll use paddle. It's for question. Answer on. We'll have a bit of a Q and a session midway through this lecture. Yeah, we'll be talking about climate change impacts generally. So if there's something that I don't really cover because it's such a big topic, if there's something I don't really cover, that you'd like to know more about it, this is a good place to ask a question about that. Also, if you do have any questions about the joining Melbourne modules, you can also put them in here is, well, just a reminder of where we're up to when are in midway through week four of semester. So we're coming towards the end of the core part of the subject on DS. You'll soon be starting your your first investigation. You should all be time tabled into an investigation. If you're not, please let me know or email the subject enquiries email address, which is on the Elements Page s So this week we're looking climate change impacts in the lectures on go online material, you've got a workshop which some of you will have already taken on debate, sustainable development and also respectful debate on bond. The joining Melvin module for this week is on cornerstones of good scholarship. The final joining Melbourne Module will be published on Friday of this week. So once that's done, once that's published, you'll have access to all of the parts of the joining Melbourne modules that you need to complete t complete the Hurdle task, which is due in six. I think it's the sixth of April anyway. Okay, so just before we talk more about impacts of climate change, it's worth just recapping what we know about climate change. Generally keep this very brief, but as I've already explained, we know the world is warming weaken measure the fact that the world is warming and we can see that it's warmed by about 1.2 degrees Celsius relative to pre industrial levels. The warming is accelerating a swell on DWI. Excuse me. So we also know that carbon dioxide increase is behind global warming. So we have a natural greenhouse effect. We have carbon oxide naturally in our atmosphere that helps to keep the planet habitable. But we've The problem is we've added greenhouse gases that enhance the greenhouse effect and warmed the planet. So we know that the world is warming and we know why the world is warming on. But it's not just the fact that the world is warming, but that has lots of effects. Locally, no one actually experiences the global average temperature. We're always, you know, we're each in a place which is experiencing different climate changes almost everywhere around the world is warming quite substantially quite quickly. But nowhere does it actually look exactly like the global temperature. So riel experience local climates and locally, what we see when we look, a temperature changes. This is a figure that I showed in the online content for week two. So I believe all seen this before. But the more we warm the planet, the Mawr, each part of the surface warms that there is a pattern to the warming. We can see that some areas warm faster than others, eh? So we can see what's called arctic amplification. The Arctic region is warming at least twice. A fast is the global average s O. That means that when we have two degrees of global warming, most parts of the Arctic, it's actually more like four degrees of local warming in that region. We can also see that the land is warming faster than the ocean. That's quite clear as well s Oh, that's because water has a very high specific capacity. Hopefully, that's a concept you come across before in high school chemistry. But warm up water requires more energy than warming up other materials, including the land surface. So Theo, the ocean takes longer to warm up in the land surface, and also the ocean is a fluid. So if you heat the surface that some of that can be transferred deeper into the ocean, water moves around, whereas with the land surface, it doesn't really Verlander's and really move around in the same way. So the heating just stays at the land surface. So we've got this pattern of global warming Is pattern of climate change or temperature change as a function of global warming, and we could see because everyone lives online. Of course, most people experience more warming than the global average so many people have already experienced at least 1.5 degrees of local warming in the location that they're at. So most people experiencing MAWR more temperature change than the global average temperature would suggest. If we look at different levels of global warming, we see that the pattern kind of stays the same, but amplifies so you've still got the same pattern where the Arctic is warming faster than other areas where land is warming faster than the ocean. But it's we're just talking about higher amounts of warming as the world warms more. If we look at rainfall changes or precipitation, changes of precipitation encapsulates rainfall on DSS. Know when anything else that falls from the sky like hail. What we see is a more complex pattern. No everywhere is getting wetter or drier someplace is getting better some places getting drier, some places as more uncertainty and changes as well. But in general again, the pattern that we have amplifies so locally if you're in a place that's getting wetter, the amount of getting wetter increases as a function of global warming. So, for example, if you look at somewhere like northern Canada, that's going from getting a bit wetter, too, getting a lot wetter as a function of global warming, other areas of getting drier and places like Perth. The drying is projected to increase as a function of global warming, so the pattern is again being intensified. But the actual shape of the pattern stays roughly the same. It's just this amplification as a function of global warming, it tends to be the areas of the planet that are already quite wet, that projected to get wetter S O places around the equator and also higher latitude regions, whereas subtropical areas which are already quite dry, projected to get drier. So what this means is, the more we warm the planet, the larger the local temperature change in the larger the local rainfall change that we see at each kind of location around the world on D. It's kind of the same. With climate change impacts the mawr, we warm the planet the worst. The impacts are projected to be so if we were looking so global warming versus local warming. It follows roughly this kind of linear relationship in most parts of the world. And that translates through two Most climate change impacts are worse, Aziz. Well, the more we warm the planet. There are exceptions to this. So s O. There are some impacts of climate change that may kind of saturate at a global warming level and then not get worse if we warm the planet beyond that level. So a good example of this and I'll talk about this mawr later in the in the lecture is the damage we're doing to coral reefs through warming the planet. We don't have to. If we warm the planet by 1.5 or two degrees, we see much more damage to coral reefs. But beyond about two degrees, it doesn't really get any worse. We've already kind of ruined that ecosystem. So two degrees versus three degrees versus four degrees of global warming doesn't make a huge difference to coral. Reefs are already destroyed, essentially just very disheartening message. But it's an important thing for people to know. We'll talk more about that later. That's kind of an exceptional case. Most things just get worse as we warm the planet. Also, that's kind of really true on a global scale, like if we look at, say, impacts of sea level rise on coastal infrastructure globally averaged that increases as a function of global warming. But at the local level, it's more complicated. There's more uncertainty, but there's also individual extreme events can have a big impact on can have a big short term impact that isn't then reached again for a long period of time, even as the world continues to warm. So I'm just going to give an example of this in the next two or three slides. S 01 major impact of the weather is on hospitalizations, onder excess mortality. If you have extreme temperatures, you tend to see increased hospital admissions on did increased death rates on Beacon Weaken model This So, for example, in a place like Sidney, this'd is Theo. Ex axes on this graph is temperature on the Y axis is risk ratio relative to the optimal temperature in terms of health impacts. How much? How many more deaths do we expect to see at each temperature? So, for example, in Sydney, the optimal temperature for minimising the impact of weather on health is around 23 degrees Celsius around here. If we have higher temperatures or lower temperatures than that, we tend to see excess fatalities that could be attributed to the weather. And if we get really extreme hot temperatures, we could be talking about a deceased. A 50% increase in the number of fatalities in a given week just associated with the temperature's being higher so that 1.5 equates to 50% increase. And this curve follows different patterns in different parts of the world. So in places like Toronto in Canada, which is more used to colder weather, we don't really see increases in mortality, even at very cold temperatures like minus 20 degrees Celsius. But we do at hotter temperatures, so extreme temperatures air associated with more people going to hospital, more people becoming ill. And unfortunately, more people dying. The excess deaths aren't just related to things like people literally like freezing to death or boiling to death. It's not just hypothermia or heat stroke. It's more that extreme temperatures put a strain on the body on DS, particularly in cardio vascular on respiratory conditions. So if you pre people already have underlying health conditions, extreme temperatures can exacerbate those. There's much more about health on climate change impacts in the online material, but just to look at a case study for a particular region in western North America. There was a really big heat wave a couple of years ago. Some of you might remember that being in the news, that was really bad. Fires in western Canada temperatures approaching 50 degrees in western Canada, exceeding past records by a very large margin. We saw a big spike in mortality related to this event. So this these graphs show excess deaths by week for the American state of Oregon, which is here Onder Washington, which is the Northwest State. We could see that during the heat wave the red bars there were lots of access deaths, even though this was after this was during the pandemic after the worst of the pandemic, when they'd already been excess deaths related to co Vered s o. This event, because of the heat because of reduced air quality due to wildfire, contributed to a lot of excess deaths. So if we are interested in the climate, the relationship between global warming and excess fatalities due to heat globally, it will follow a relationship roughly like this. But at the local level, it will follow a relationship more like this where we get spikes when we have particular extreme events. So if we were looking at the Northwest and United States regional Southwestern Canada, we'd see a spike on then we probably wouldn't see that spike surpassed for quite a few years or even decades. Adi individual level we see really big extremes on those are always matched or surpassed for quite a few years or or even decades. So there are many aspect of the world around us that are affected by climate change. I kind of mentioned that at the beginning, just talked about human health a little bit. So people we do see big spikes in mortality when we have extreme temperatures. But also, if we have changes in rainfall, then that can affect water supply in different parts of the world. It could mean more flooding and more contamination of fresh water supplies. If you have much more rainfall than you're used to in the past, if you have less rainfall, that might mean drive on water restrictions. We also see climate change impacts on ecosystems, ecosystems. Many ecosystems are very sensitive to changes in temperature and rainfall on D, as we project big changes in local temperatures and rainfall that can have a big impact, especially on less mobile ecosystems. What aspect of ecosystems? So plants, for example, don't really have the same ability? Some animals. D'oh. We also see climate change impacts on agriculture. So we see reduced crop yields have received reductions in rainfall that can pose problems for food supply. Climate change impacts on physical infrastructure both through extreme events. So if you have more heat or flood events that can damage infrastructure also through sea level rise damaging coastal infrastructure on also air quality as well, so air quality is strongly related to the weather s. So if we have, if we have in Melbourne, say very windy conditions and heavy rain as we get weather front's moving through, that's quite good for air quality that cleans up the if we have very still conditions. Very light winds that allies pollution to build over the city that can also be associated with increased hospital admissions are worst air quality days in Melbourne at the moment. Typically, when we have easterly winds, the winds coming from the east because we have power stations to our east in the Latrobe Valley in eastern Victoria. So when the pollution from those coal power plants passes over Melbourne. That reduces our air quality quite significantly. Also, if we have Bush fires near US, re tendency reductions in air quality. So if we were to have a change in weather patterns, say we had Maura of those still days in Melbourne, that would mean a reduction in air quality. So there's there's lots of ways that climate change impacts the world around us. I'm just going to talk kind of generally about how hard it is to make projections of impacts of climate change, though so later on our talk a bit more about specific impacts of climate change s so it's really important that we're able to project how climate change effects the world around us effects things like ecosystems or health impacts because those have really big consequences. We need to know if we're going to see extreme mawr extreme temperature days that are associated with MAWR with higher mortality rates so that we can try and adapt to those and maybe try and prevent some of those deaths occurring in the future. The problem is that it's quite tricky. Todo simulate and project climate change in points. So in Week two I talked about climate models and how we use climate models to understand the climate. Earth's climate on DHS to test hypotheses like is our human activity is causing the world to warm through enhancing the greenhouse effect S O. We also use these climate models to simulate future temperature and future rainfall. Like the maps I was showing you earlier. But they don't directly simulate things like ecosystem changes. They don't directly simulate agricultural crop yields for example, livestock effects of climate change or health impacts. They just simulate things like future temperature and rainfall. So to actually make solid projections of climate change impacts, we need to have a really good understanding of the relationship between climate variables on the impacts that we're interested in. So there's kind of multiple steps in this. We can make projections as a function of time or global warming level of climate variable, so temperature or rainfall changes in a particular region. We can also try and work out the relationship between a climate variable andan impact variable. So, for example, temperature on bond excess mortality. But then there's uncertainty in this relationship. There's already a bit of uncertainty in the projections for the climate variable. So when we try make projections of the impact variable itself, there's even Maura uncertainty. We've compounded the uncertainty. S o typically uncertainty and climate change. Impact projections tends to be greater than it is for just so temperature or rainfall. In many cases, the relationship between the climate variable and the impact variable is quite complicated on it's quite hard to establish. It's not always linear. This is a good example of a non linear relationship with temperatures and access fatalities. So this would complicate. There's also uncertainty in this relationship. The grey bar behind this red and blue line is representing a degree of uncertainty. So that means we have quite a lot of uncertainty in future as a function of global warming. How many future access death. So we're going to get in Sydney, for example. The other problem here is that we have much better data, a much better understanding of relationships between climate variables and impacts in higher income regions of the world. We have much more data about the climate itself and how the climate is changing on. We also have more data about related to the impacts of climate change. So in Australia, we do have data about hospital admissions about excess deaths. We don't have that in parts of sub Saharan Africa, for example. So it's very hard then to make projections of how global warming relates to access deaths in parts of sub Saharan Africa. S O, generally looking at climate impacts, is trickier in lower income regions of the world. There's many reasons for this. There's also there's generally less resilience, typically to climate extremes or just natural climate variability in lower income regions of the world. Unfortunately, a really good example of this being played out at the moment and you might have heard in the news yesterday I saw it was in the news that there was this striped. There's a very big gripes in eastern Africa at the moment. It's hopefully finishing in places like Somalia and Ethiopia. There's been about 40,000 deaths linked to that drives really astonishing number of excess deaths due to malnourishment, primarily that drives in Somalia isn't really worsened by climate change. That's just an aspect of variability in the climate system. That region of the world does experience drives from time to time they're not getting. They don't appear to be getting worse as the planet warms. So even in just the current climate, we see really big, really bad extreme events which caused really major impacts, particularly in lower income regions of the world. So as we warm the planet, we tend to see that in lower income regions of the world. We expect those impacts generally to get a lot worse, which is really, really concerning. There's also in lower income regions of the world. There's a lot less adaptive capacity. Esso weaken. When we have extreme events in Australia, way kind of learn from them and make changes, it's harder on we can invest in doing that. We can weaken, try and reduce the possibility of future climate change impacts. So we see that at the moment. For example, we had the really bad floods in Australia last year in New South Wales and Victoria Andre. We're seeing investment in trying to prevent similar types of floods affecting lots of properties again in the future. It's a lot harder to do that if you don't have the money in the first place to do that. I think that's really a good argument for why high high income nations should be providing a lot more support to low income nations to cope with climate change, impacts generally or even just impacts of the current severe weather that we experience in our climate of today, not just what we anticipate experiencing in the future on also, in some cases, lower income nations air just unfortunately, in regions of the world where climate impacts are worse in some ways. So a good example of this is with heatwave impacts typically on average higher income nations, typically in higher latitude regions of the world so further away from the equator, places like North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, East Asia as well. Where is the poorest parts of the world are also areas of the world are hotter, the experience more heat waves on bond, just hotter temperatures generally. So there is an aspect of this where lower income nations air just in the wrong places as well and likely experience worse impacts of heat, particularly S O. I thought this might be a good time to have a bit of a question and answer session, so I'll just leave this up for a moment before going to the Pablo S. O. If you've got any questions, scan this Q R code on bond. Ask him in the padlock or just put your hand up. If you'd like to ask that way. After this Q and a session, we'll talk more about climate change impacts more specifically to do with different aspect of impacts of ecosystems. Health, for example. Just going to the pad Luds. So, yeah, I will say I mean so. It's kind of, you know, this is a really serious issue like, this is this is going to change the planet over the next few decades. It's, you know, it's already killing thousands of people. It's damaging the world around us. So I think it is something you should be taking seriously. It's, you know, it's kind of worrying if you don't really think this is a serious problem in terms of Okay, so the question about nuclear power So there is, I think there is a kind of AH discussion around nuclear power on DS. Tackling climate change at the moment is nuclear Part is associated with lower emissions of carbon dioxide using coal, oil or gas. The problem is, has other risks as well, and it does generate waste that doesn't that just stays there for a very long time. So it's not. It's also extremely expensive, especially in countries don't have nuclear power capability. At the moment, it's hard to kind of build that capability from from not having it. Also, in countries like Australia, it would cost a lot to build nuclear power plants. We have abundant, you know, wind on DS Solar resource is so you know there are other options, but there is. I do think there is a valid debate around nuclear power that could be heard. It's obviously a kind of a hot button issue, though different people with very strong opinions on it. So in terms of just read the Arctic warming. So yeah, there's there's a good point around greenhouse gas emissions, and then where we experience where we see climate change impacts. So our emissions of greenhouse gases are primarily from places where there are human activities where we have power plants where we have cities. But carbon dioxide goes into the atmosphere on becomes fairly well mixed fairly quickly in the atmosphere, so it doesn't really matter in terms of the effect on the Earth's climate, it doesn't really matter where the carbon dioxide is admitted. If it's omitted from Australia or China or Western Europe, it doesn't. It'll just going into the atmosphere and mixing and having the same effect on the planet as a whole. The reason for Arctic amplification is partly because the Arctic there are more complex reasons aspect to this. But part of it's because the Arctic is ice covered on DS. As the ice melts, it's replaced by a darker ocean surface, so the ice is very reflective of incoming solar radiation. But the ocean surface more effectively absorbs that radiation on warms up. So that's partly why way get faster warming over the Arctic than elsewhere on the planet. Nuclear energy isn't really considered renewable as such because it does require resource is aren't fully renewable. So it's not. It doesn't only fall into this class of renewable energy. It's definitely it is a lower mission, low greenhouse gas emission form of electricity generation. So Project willow is this'll recently been in the news. This is a new I think it's I can't remember if it's an oil or gas pipeline has been approved in the U. S. That would facilitate Mawr fossil fuel use. Suddenly, you know, if you read some of the statements associated with the new IPCC report conclusions, What they really highlight is if we're going to limit global warming to very low levels, like 1.5 degrees we cannot use, we cannot open more fossil, fuel based kind of resource is we can't generate electricity. We shouldn't be opening new coal power plants if we're going to. If we're aiming to meet the Paris agreement, so yes, certainly these projects do have an impact, especially taken together when there's lots of these projects cumulative. Cumulatively, they have an impact. Yes, it's It's always concerning when these kinds of things were approved. The question on Elissa Esso Alyssa is contactable with her email, but she is very busy, so she can't always respond very quickly because there are over 2.5 hours interview in the subject. It doesn't mean that there are times when we can always reply to your e mails. Certainly not very quickly. S o. I encourage you to use forums like this Todo todo ask us questions. I don't think Elissa has officers. I do have office hours, and I'll advertising more prominently for next week. In case you've got any further questions, I'll just cover this question on covert and climate change, and then we'll go back to the lecture slides. So, yeah, there's certainly during the lot dines. We did see much fewer greenhouse, much lower greenhouse gas emissions. We did see reduced pollution as well in many major cities s oh, there were lots of interesting outcomes. It's kind of a strange experiment to run. If you think about changing hi, people behave and then seeing the consequences on lots of different aspect of society in the environment. The most of the impacts of the LA Times, though, have really they've already passed. Like we've seen the pollution return. We've seen the greenhouse gas emissions return The maybe are some lessons from the lot diamond so around, not using things like cars as much. Reed saw a big reduction in people's mobility, obviously during coded lock downs. Since then, we've seen kind of this hybrid people working from home on DS in officers, and that's had benefits in terms of reduced pollution as well. So There are some maybe lessons to learn from the LA times of what could be done sustainably. Some of the things that you know, the lock times were temporary measures to prevent the spread of coverted. But s obviously it's not really sustainable to do a love those measures all the time, but might be aspect of what we did that could be continued to try and reduce climate change effects on the I'll just briefly answer the expert talk question as well, eh? So don't worry. If you weren't able to attend the expert to live on Monday, there wasn't really a time we could do it where everyone was available, um, or 2.5 1000. So we held it live. But we also recorded it. The recording. I haven't really advertised it being on Al amiss yet. I'm going to I'm writing the assignment question to go with it, and I'll send an announcement about that, possibly in the next couple of days. If not be the start of next week. I will, I will. I just briefly had this question as well, because it is. I don't want you to become completely demoralised about climate change either should take it seriously, but also not be completely completely disheartened about either. There are things that can be done. You know, I think the biggest thing that individuals can do is try and influence the path that governments take. We can take individual actions which are helpful, but, you know, on our own on the individual scale, it's not enough to have a really big impact. So we need to influence governments of governments, take leadership on addressing climate change properly thes IPCC reports like the one that came out yesterday. We've had multiple IPCC reports before, even well before you were born and before I was born. And they've all said the same thing really, with with a bit more detail each time. So we've known about the problem for a very long time. We haven't addressed it properly. I'll talk more about that next week. We'll be looking at why we haven't addressed climate change properly yet On bond solutions to climate change. I'm going to go back to the lecture slides, so I'm just going to talk. I'll go through this fairly quickly, but I'll just talk generally about impacts of climate change. We see a Z s o these grafts from the recent IPCC report these air not They've made the graphs a bit nicer since I made the slides, but generally s oh, this this top left graph just shows global average temperature increasing historically and increasing under different emissions scenarios for greenhouse gases thistles. The higher mission scenario low emission scenario down here a to moment we're on track for something close to that orange line in the middle on each of these bars shows projected impacts on different aspect of ecosystems around the world s o the the deeper the colour, the worst, the impact. So going from yellow, orange, red to purple and what we see on me on the Y axis is still the global average warming. So what we can see is that for some aspect of ecosystem damage, like wildfire increase, it gets a lot worse the more you warm the planet. But as I mentioned before for warm water corals, we really see the damage already at the moment. In our current climate and beyond about two degrees of global warming, it doesn't really make much difference. The impact stays roughly the same. So just to touch on that A bit more coral bleaching on coral death is already occurring after 1.2 degrees of global warming. We see a very tight relationship between the temperatures that coral experiences on de coral bleaching. So it's just when you have high temperatures in the seas, the coral bleaches coral bleaching means so normally, coral is quite colourful. But then, when it becomes stressed by high temperatures, expels RG and it turns into a very white colour like this. We've seen major coral bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef quite a few times in the last couple of decades. Last last 20 years, also 25 years on, it's happening with increasing frequency. The 2016 event was associated with really high temperatures that this map shows anomalies of temperature in the ocean during March 2016, and you can see it's mostly read. It was warmer than average around the Great Barrier Reef on D. We saw really bad bleaching that year. That event alone resulted in about a quarter of the shallow coral on the Great Barrier Reef dying, so we're already seeing big impacts of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef The other thing is, we know coral bleaching basically wouldn't occur without our influence on the climate Way just wouldn't get the temperature's high enough in the seas around coral reefs to get major coral bleaching events. So we know it's It's one of these climate impacts that weaken directly attribute to human activities. If we think about human health and climate change again, we see that as the more we warm the planet, the worst health outcomes become S o. The higher we'd have. The MAWR events would have with really high rates of excess mortality on also worse impacts of things like malaria as well. But also there's a really strong, effective adaptation when it comes to health impacts of climate change. There are some simple things that we can do to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change on human health. I'm just going to give a quick example here way saw, for example, in 2003, about 20 years ago now there was a really big heat wave in Western Europe that led to about 70,000 excess deaths. So we're talking a really large number of access death. It was a record breaking heat wave really high temperatures that hadn't seen been seen before. But there was a similar heat wave just three years later that only lead to about 3.5 1000 deaths. So much fewer deaths, even with similar temperatures. Really, the 2003 heat wave highlighted the problems with high people were managing extreme heat events. There was less air conditioning. There was just generally misunderstanding about what to do during heat events, particularly in France. But then there were major changes made. Improvements in public communication on this was associated with reduced impacts. So there's even though things get worse. As we warm the planet, we can adapt to some extent and reduce some of the worst impacts of climate change. We see other impacts, though beyond heat impacts S O, for example, flood events commonly increase the chance of waterborne disease, especially in low income regions of the world. But even we even see problems in places like Australia. So, for example, you might remember that in southeast Australia last year during the floods, there was an outbreak of Japanese encephalitis, which is a virus carried by mosquitoes may have infected quite a lot of people in parts of Southeast Australia. I'm going to skip over this quite briefly. But just to say that the IPCC report also goes into regional impacts of climate change in a lot of detail on highlights for regions like Australasia. The big impacts. Unsurprisingly, for Australia, it's a coral reef impact that because the lowest levels of global warming most clearly. But then we also see other impacts of climate change on populations in Australasia really kicking in around one degree of global warming and getting a lot worse as we continue to warm the planet, particularly through extreme heat and sea level rise impacts. If you think about Australian cities, most Australians live in coastal areas. Many live very near the currency level. So with sea level rise on day when we have extreme weather events that cause storm surges, we do anticipate having a lot more damage to coastal infrastructure and property in coastal parts of Australia. I also I want to finish up just briefly talking about sustainable development goals on, but hopefully you you saw this in the video. The online content last week s o. The United Nations has thes 17 sustainable development goals There is one associative risk climb action, but they're kind of one of the point I was making last week is that often policy to tackle sustainable, to improve sustainability has multiple benefits beyond just the direct benefit you might think of. So I think I gave the example of greening our cities that improves just the natural environment around us, improves air quality. They also makes people generally happy, improves mental well being on so forth. Generally, this is also true with the sustainable development goals. If we implement policies to tackle climate change, that also helps in many in achieving many of the other sustainable development goals. So one way that the IPCC has kind of tried to show this and this is quite complicated schematic. But it's generally showing that if we try and tackle climate change properly, follow a pathway like the Green Line. If we do that alongside achieving other sustainable development goals, that will lead to a much better future planet with lots of benefits, even just from tackling climate change properly. If we don't tackle climate change properly, it's also more likely to be associated with worse inequality, more poverty, just generally Ah worse world to inhabit, so we're kind of a point where we can choose to follow different paths. Onder The latest IPCC report is really making the point that we need Tiu. If we're going to really minimise the impact of climate change, we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions rapidly in the next five years. Also. Okay, so I'm just just in conclusion, generally, studying climate change impacts is complicated on different sources of uncertainty. It's harder than just looking at projections of temperature or rainfall, because then we have to look at the impact of those changes on the impacts that we're interested in studying. There are some changes that can be adapted to and others that can't. So I highlighted with extreme heat and health impacts. You can make quite big difference just even by teaching people what to do during heat events, staying hydrated, not going outside in the middle of the day, for example, ecosystems don't have the same adaptive capacity so we can warm the planet and reduce heat heat impacts on health, particularly in wealthier nations. But that doesn't mean that we can protect the Great Barrier Reef from from the impacts of climate change. There's big inequality and climate change impacts and also our ability to adapt to them. We need to address that properly. There are many impacts of climate change that worsen as a function of global warming. On this, hopefully is a powerful incentive to achieve the Paris agreement goals. Next week we're going to be talking more about solutions to climate change on why we haven't tackled climate change properly so far, so I'll see you next week.

SPEAKER 1
OK, Um hi, everyone. Um so welcome to this Week five lecture. We'll be talking about environmental challenges comparing different environmental challenges, one that we've tackled very successfully the ozone hole and one that we haven't done so well with to date. At least I'm just going to start off this week's lecture, though with a couple of kind of side announcements. So one thing I've been asked to advertise, um, which I think is quite a neat kind of citizen science project that the university is running this April is something called uni Bio Quest. And it's basically asking students to download an app and then, um, keep track of any species, animals or plant species that you see on campus during the month of April. Um, so even though they've got pictures of koalas, I don't think you'll see koalas on campus. I've never seen koalas on campus. Uh, I guess you might see galas and you might see some mushrooms somewhere or rainbow lariats as well. But essentially, the idea is that the university is trying to keep track of the wildlife on the campus. So if you record sightings of any species you see during April, you can help the university keep track of wildlife and protect biodiversity. You don't need any experience and you can win. Uh, one of two gift vouchers. So these are just the instructions. Um, these are all in the slides that are on l MS. But you just download an app and then register and then collect and identify any sightings. Um, so there's lots more information. I'll just leave the QR code up there a second in case any of you are interested. Um, yeah, hopefully kind of a fun thing to do that helps the university kind of see, I mean, it's obviously important to know if we're seeing increases or decreases in different kinds of wildlife around campus. Ok, um, so this is the QR code for the pads. So, as I said, we're going to be talking about environmental challenges this week and how we tackle them. Um, so yeah, Please put your questions here, Um, in the Pats, Um, or just ask questions. Um, raising your hand as well. That's also fine. One thing I thought I'd mention before we get started properly. We're in Week five. Now I've posted a couple of announcements about the joining Melbourne modules and the evaluation of an expert talk assignment, so I thought I'd just draw your attention to those. All the joining Melbourne modules have now been published. So you've got access to everything with respect to the joining Melbourne modules that you need to complete in order to kind of pass that hurdle. That's part of this subject. So just as a reminder, there are four assessment hurdles for this subject. There's completing all the joining, joining Melbourne module tasks. There's the assignment on the evaluation of an expert talk. And then there's a group assignment linked to investigation one and an individual assignment linked to investigation two. Um so I'll just go to those announcements with the joining Melbourne modules. Those are actually due next week. So, um, by the sixth of April at five PM, I've tried to make this as straightforward as possible by giving a checklist of all the things you need to have done by that time. Um, so you have to have completed all the discussion posts and the quizzes, Not not just the quizzes. And you have to have achieved at least 80% on each quiz as well. Um, So hopefully you've been doing these as we've been going through the the semester and as the joining Melbourne modules have been published, um, but even if you haven't, I'd really encourage you to to complete these tasks. ASAP, um you don't want to leave it till the last minute. Um, if you've got any questions about that, um, you're free to put up your hand or, um, post them in the tablet. Oh, yeah. The other thing I was going to mention is the evaluation of an expert talk assignment. Again, all the instructions have been published online, including the assignment submission page. That's not due for a while, Um, about a month from now. But we've already had the expert talk from a But that was on Monday last week. Um, the, um the rubrics been provided as well, so hopefully the instructions are very clear. Um, I'll just go to the page anyway. Basically, you have to answer this question. What controls earth climate on timescales of millions of years and then describe similarities and differences with what controls Earth's climate change over much shorter timescales over the last century? Um, the key thing I really wanted to highlight, and it's in the rubric as well. To get a high mark in this assignment, you do need to reference the expert talk and the lectures or online content suitably, Um, if you do not provide suitable references to the expert talk or the lectures, um, and the lectures or online content, Um, that limits how high your grade can be. Um, you won't get into these kind of excellent categories. You have to get at least 50% on this assignment. To pass this hurdle, um, you will get a numerical grade. This has to be above that 50% line to to pass the hurdle if you don't have references, suitable references to the expert talk and the lectures, and that means you're more at risk of not getting to that 50% mark because it kind of reduces how high your grade can be. And then if there's kind of another problem with the assignment, you might drop below that 50% mark. Um, so it's really important that you, um, provide suitable references. Um, the It's not a very long assignment. It's 800 words. Um, the week six workshop, um, should be useful for completing this assignment. It it goes through, um, skills around, um, researching, um to to write an assignment, finding suitable references and avoiding academic misconduct. So I'd recommend obviously going to that and using what you learn in that workshop to help you with this assignment. Um, if you've got any questions about the assignments again, um, feel free to put them in the pale. Um, so I'm gonna move on to the actual content for this, um, this lecture, Um, So we've talked the last few weeks. We've talked quite a bit about climate change, impacts of climate change and sustainable development, But, um, I kind of wanted to highlight that humanity has dealt with environmental challenges before, and fairly successfully. We just haven't really dealt with the climate change crisis very well. So the ozone hole is the example. I'm going to talk about the most detail today, but there are other examples to do with air pollution and acid rain. Acid rain was a bigger problem in the 19 sixties and 19 seventies in parts of Europe and North America, especially, and it was to do with pollution and industrial activity, and it was causing lots of damage. And efforts were made to stop it happening involving cleaning up pollution, improving air quality and those have had an effect, Um, so we can deal with big environmental challenges. We just haven't dealt with the climate change crisis. Um, so we've known about climate change for a very long time, and I go into more detail on that later on. Um, but just to highlight, you know, it's actually almost 20 years now since, um, an Inconvenient Truth came out. So some of you might have seen this film by Al Gore, who was a US vice president, president And that film came out in 2006, I think. And we've also had, um, multinational reports on climate change and the impacts of climate change going back over 35 years now. So, well, before you were all born before I was born, um, we we've had these United Nations reports being done on climate change, these Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change reports. So we even as early as the late 19 eighties, there was a recognition that there was a need for a multinational effort to tackle climate change. But, you know, that was 35 years ago and we in that intervening period, we've just increased our greenhouse gas emissions and increased the rate of global warming. So we've known about climate change for a long time. We just haven't dealt with the problem. Um, so we we just haven't really tackled the problem head on. We've allowed global warming to continue, but the ozone hole represents kind of a very different environmental problem where we did tackle that problem head on. And we're now seeing the benefits of tackling that problem and not just letting it letting it kind of fester. So, um, the ozone hole well, firstly, ozone naturally occurs in the atmosphere at quite high levels in the atmosphere in the stratosphere, around 20 kilometres up in the atmosphere, we have this layer of ozone, but we do have these days every year, a seasonal minimum that forms over Antarctica around late winter, early spring um So this animation I'm just going to play in a minute shows the thickness of ozone in the stratosphere in the upper atmosphere and where you've got green, orange and red colours. You've got more ozone than it when we've got blue and purple. Um, so during August, this is just for 2019, but it kind of follows a similar path in each year. We see this reduction in ozone over Antarctica in this kind of circle this, um, minimum in ozone and it's it kind of reaches its peak around September, so you can see it forming in August and then deepening as we go through September. And then by October it starts to fill in again. So the reason we care about this, I mean, partly because it's a change in the atmosphere that we've seen we saw back in the late 19 seventies and early 19 eighties, this ozone whole forming. But we care about this partly because ozone is very helpful at protecting us from harmful ultraviolet radiation. So the ozone in the upper atmosphere philtres out this harmful U V B radiation, one of the types of ultraviolet radiation from the sun and prevents it reaching the surface, and this form of radiation can cause skin cancer. So it's not good if we if we see a reduction in ozone in the upper atmosphere, that allows more of this radiation to reach the surface and harm people at the surface. Um, so we have, yeah, this ozone in the upper atmosphere. That's kind of protecting us from this ultraviolet radiation. We do have human emissions of ozone from things like car pollution. So we do have ozone near the surface as well, which is not a good thing because it's harmful to human health, breathing in ozone but helpful having it higher up in the atmosphere where we're not breathing it in. But it's it's preventing that e v radiation reaching the surface. So why do we have the ozone in the upper atmosphere? Um, so ozone is, um, a molecule made up of three oxygen atoms, and it basically forms when we have oxygen molecules being going through this process of what's called photo dissociation. So where sunlight interacts with oxygen molecules and breaks up the molecules into individual atoms, and then these merge with other oxygen molecules to form ozone molecules these three oxygen atoms. So we have this natural layer of ozone in the stratosphere. Um, and that's been around as far as we know for for millions of years. But what we saw, what we were seeing in the 19 seventies and early 19 eighties is this hole in the ozone layer forming. And this was because of, um, chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which were produced by human activities. They are not a naturally occurring gas. Um, but they were manufactured as a refrigerant, um, to help. Um, So in older refrigerators, um, c f CS were used as a refrigerant to help, um, keep things cool. And but But there are emissions of seas as well into the atmosphere, and these very effectively rose up into the stratosphere and depleted ozone concentration, particularly over Antarctica. Um, so the reason that this, um, ozone hole formed over Antarctica is because all the kind of ingredients for ozone depletion, um, were in place, um, in in kind of early spring over Antarctica. Um, so we have when we have, um, chlorofluorocarbons and also halos, which are used in propellants. So things like hair spray. They were used in the 19 seventies and 19 eighties, these gases rose in the atmosphere and brought with them chemicals that, uh, basically speed up ozone destruction is a chlorine and bromine. So the release of CFCs and halos at the surface through human activities. The CFCs then went up in the atmosphere and as they reached the stratosphere and interacted with incoming solar radiation and chlorine and bromine were released. And chlorine and bromine are catalysts that speed up reactions that cause ozone destruction. So ozone destruction occurs when you have a few ingredients in place, these catalysts, but also very low temperatures, but also e v radiation. And that's why we see the ozone hole forming over Antarctica in early spring. Because that's after the winter, when there have been very cold temperatures forming over Antarctica over Antarctica. In winter, there is no sunlight. But then, as we get towards the spring equinox, um, there is a return of sunlight over much of Antarctica, and that, coupled with the low temperatures and having chlorine and burning catalysts, results in ozone destruction and an ozone hole forming over Antarctica. So we have this. It's a very seasonal effect. We don't see the ozone hole in other other times of year, like in summer or autumn as much we do see because of our CFC emissions. In the past, we do see less ozone than we would normally see if we hadn't emitted those CFCs. But we don't see a very distinct ozone hole at other times of year outside of August, September and October. So the ozone hole only really started forming in the late 19 seventies. That's when these C F CS started to be used in refrigeration and when halos were used in aerosol sprays. Things like hair sprays or anti and the ozone hole started forming in the late 19 seventies and it was already observed by the early to mid 1980 s. So only a few years after the ozone hole formed, scientists detected there was a problem. Basically. So this paper, published in 1985 called large losses of total ozone in Antarctica. This basically highlighted that there was a problem and there was already work from the late 19 seventies showing that chlorofluorocarbons lasted a very long time in the atmosphere. So the problem with them not just that they cause that they trigger ozone destruction in the upper atmosphere, but they hang around in the atmosphere for a very long time up to thousands of years. So we were rapidly using up using CFCs and emitting CFCs and causing the eurozone hole to form and grow in the late 19 seventies and early 19 eighties. And there was a recognition from scientists and then from governments and policy makers that there was an urgent need to stop this happening. And so by 1987. So this is only two years after this paper was published, and only seven or eight years after the problem started, we had an international agreement called the Montreal Protocol that was agreed and ratified by almost all countries around the world. So what's happened with the ozone hole? It only started forming around 1980. And this this graph just shows the average ozone hole area in September early October, when it at its maximum through time and you can see it grows through the 19 eighties and early 19 nineties and then kind of flat lines. Um, after the mon protocol takes place takes effect. So the protocol was signed in 1987 and it took effect from about 1989. And we see because of the Montreal Protocol, where countries agree to stop using CFCs and pays that we've basically stopped the ozone hole growing further, it's still a problem. It's not really shrunk, but it's not really growing, either. We have really high year to year variability in the size of the ozone hole, but at least it's not really getting worse. So the whole, um, we identified the problem. In the late 19 seventies, early 19 eighties, we had a protocol agreed to in 1987 and in effect from 1989. So only 10 years after the problem started, we had this protocol in effect for climate change. Um, we've known about it much longer than we've known about the problem Emerged started to emerge much earlier than the um, we've known about the problem for a very long time, and we haven't dealt with the problem yet, So if we look all the way back to 18 56 so we're talking about almost 100 and 70 years ago, very, very long time ago, there was a scientist called Eus Newton Foot, and she demonstrated basically that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. It effectively absorbs and emits long wave radiation. So if you remember back to Week two, we talked about the fact that the sun emits shortwave radiation because it's very hot. The earth is a lot colder and emits wave sorry radiation at longer wavelengths as a result. And greenhouse gases are basically gases that effectively absorb radiation at that longer wavelength, and we emit it in all directions. So UN boat found that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. It absorbs and emits long wave radiation. And in 18 56 she hypothesised that increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would cause the world to win. So at that time, the world wasn't really warming. Yet there had already been the start of the Industrial Revolution. That kind of really started in the late 17 hundreds, but it was quite slow to really get going. Um, we already had the steam engine by then, um, and the the C 02 in the atmosphere was starting to increase. Um, but it's really very kind of early to be able to be making that kind of hypothesis. It's kind of remarkable that she was making that hypothesis all the way back in 18 56. By 1938 there was already a recognition that the world was warming. So Guy Callander published a paper with this figure in it showing the amount of um showing the warming of the planet over time. This is just from 18 80 to the mid 19 thirties. You can already see just gathering data from weather stations around the world, which was a lot harder to do back then. Of course, we didn't have the Internet or computers or anything like that, just gathering paper records. He was able to show that the Earth was warming and he linked it to the rise in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. So that was 85 years ago. By that stage, we already knew about the greenhouse effects from work by UNICE and others, and we already knew that because of the rise in co. Two in the atmosphere of the world was warming. Um, and it's kind of remarkable above 85 years ago, there's still sometimes people that debate whether increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere causes global warming. We've known about this for a very, very long time. Um, but, you know, we have seen further science done since, but we've not understood the fundamentals of the problem for a very, very long time, and we haven't acted on it. So there's been a really big difference in the international response to the ozone hole versus global warming. We had this roughly 10 years from the ozone hole, just even emerging to an international protocol to tackle the ozone hole with global warming. We identified the world was warming in 1938 having already understood that there was a greenhouse effect and it was being enhanced by increasing CO two in the atmosphere. We saw this gradual accumulation of scientific evidence after that, and we have had international protocols like the Kyoto Protocol in the late 19 nineties and the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015, which countries are signing up to to try and tackle climate change, but not really having the same effect with the Montreal Protocol and subsequent protocols. That was just a banning of the use of chlorofluorocarbons, whereas with these um, Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, this is about reducing the use of greenhouse gases, not just banning them all together. So um really, really different responses to large scale environmental problems between the ozone hole and climate change. So why is that? There isn't really, like one reason why we see such a difference in the response to the ozone hole and climate change, and it's quite hard not to look like we don't know definitively why there's been a difference like this is kind of speculative, but I think there's there's a few reasons that contribute to this very different response. So for climate change, there's been the slow accumulation of evidence like it took more than 60 years to go from, unless foots work, identifying that we could be warming the planet if we increase co two in the atmosphere to Guy's work showing that the world was indeed warming because of greenhouse gas emissions. And then, you know, there's been lots more work since kind of refining our understanding of climate change. But it's been quite a slow accumulation of evidence over more than a century now for the ozone hole. There was this really rapid accumulation of evidence in just two or three years in the early 19 eighties, so, um, kind of the the rapid. I mean, this is partly because there's just a lot more science done in recent decades than there used to be. There are a lot more scientists, and there's a lot more data to be studied than there used to be as well. Um, so I think that helped trigger action on the ozone hold because we very rapidly gained quite a good understanding of the problem. It's also, I think, the timing as well. So the Ozone Hall emerged in the late 19 seventies, early 19 eighties, and there was already a drive to improve Earth's environments. At that stage through the 19 sixties and 19 seventies, we'd already seen efforts to clean up air pollution generally to try and basically tackle pollution and improve air quality. So the ozone hole emerged at a time when things like spray cans were already going out of fashion and it was kind of easy for people to to tackle the problem. Anyway. We also had alternatives to chlorofluorocarbons and there were other ways. There are other refrigerants we can use. CFCs were very cheap and easy to manufacture, but there were other options, so it was quite easy just to switch out from CFCs and use a different chemical as a refrigerant. So we don't really have that with climate change as much because there are so many aspects of the economy and industry that still rely on carbon intensive energy sources. I think also the health impact of the ozone hole was more clear cut. So it was very easy to show and understand that the ozone hole would cause an increase in skin cancer cases. And that really scared people into taking action. Scared governments into taking action to prevent a public health crisis. And I mean, the other unfortunate kind of aspect of this is is probably this is tied with race in that skin cancer is more of a problem in wealthier countries. Basically places, um, it's more of a problem for for white people. And yeah, that that probably is partly why this was addressed more quickly. Whereas climate change, as we've discussed in previous in the last lecture last week, unfortunately affects the world's poorest much more. And unfortunately, you know if if wealthier people are more affected by something, there's more rapid action to tackle that problem generally, So I think that's partly why climate change hasn't been addressed properly, is that the people most affected are not the people that have contributed to greenhouse gas emissions or can adapt more easily to climate change. It's the poorest people around the world that are most impacted with climate change. We've seen lots of lobbying and vested interests to try and prevent action with the ozone hole. We didn't really see that there wasn't really any denial of the ozone hole or its effects, so there wasn't really an undermining of the science like there has been with climate change. Um, so the other thing was the time frame of impacts as well, and the ozone hole was predicted. If we hadn't done anything to address the problem and reduce or ban CFCs, we would have seen a huge increase in skin cancer cases. But because of protocols to reduce successive protocols to reduce the CFC use and eventually ban CFC use, we really brought down projections of skin cancer cases with climate change, the effects on health, the effects generally are a bit harder to detect and untangle this variability in the climate system as we've discussed, and it's kind of harder to really see those impacts until it's kind of too late in some cases, like with with the coral reefs. So I think just the rapid increase in skin cancer cases that was projected with the growing ozone hole really scared people and governments into rapid action. There's probably other reasons as well. This is just a selection of my thoughts and and those of some other scientists. So, um, for the remainder of the lecture, we're going to talk a bit more about climate change solutions. But I just thought, um, I'd pause here in case there's any questions. Um, so I'll just go to the tablets. Um, OK, so there's a couple of questions about, um, the evaluation of an expert talk. Um, I'm just going to go back to the I'll move the QR. Code up a second while I answer those questions. Um, So, um, Ash's expert talk is on the l MS site. There's a link from the announcement. I posted to, um, to the video the recording of the, um, the expert talk. Um, we we know that some of you lots of you did attend live, which was great, but we knew that we couldn't really schedule it at any time. That suited everyone in the in the subject. So we knew that lots of people would have to rely on the recording. Um, so I'll just show you exactly where the recording is. Um, it's Yeah. You can just find it by clicking on this link. Um, I'm not going to click the link because I think it will start the video, and I think it'll be quite large. Um, but yeah, it's just from this link from this announcement. Um, yes. So you do have to include in text citations to the to to the expert talk and, um, lectures or online content? Um, yes, that's correct. Um, cool. And are there any other questions? I think these questions were from, um, the last lecture. Um, does anyone else have any other questions? Yeah. Yeah. So, um, there's a question about the referencing style. Um, I don't really mind what referencing style you use as long as you're consistent throughout. So don't kind of swap between, like, harvard or a p A or one of the other ones. Just stick to one style and and, um and use it you got any other questions? There is, um, a format for referencing, uh, lectures. Um, that's kind of part of any reference style. So if you if you, um there'll be more help with this in the week six, um, workshop, which is specifically around referencing and academic misconduct. Um, but there's, um if you're using, for example, the the a p a style you can just, um, search for for how to, um, site a lecture or an expert talk? Um, Well, yeah, Just an expert talk will be cited in the same way as a lecture, actually. Cool. Um, any other questions in the room? I'll just move back to the lecture slides, then. So just for the last part of this lecture, this is the last lecture in the core content. And, um, we've talked a lot about climate change generally, and I think I've kind of emphasised the problem, which and it is a very big problem, but I don't want you to kind of I think this is just hopeless and we can't really do anything to solve the problem. There are lots of people working on trying to tackle climate change. So whilst it's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about climate change and to want to see really big changes. It's it's not really constructive. At least, um so just kind of, um the the sense of doom and gloom about it completely. So I'm just gonna talk briefly about how we actually solve the problem of climate change. Um, so I I showed this graph in, um I think in week three, um, but basically showing that we've increased our greenhouse gas emissions to date. At the moment, we're on track for about 2.5 to 3 degrees of global warming. If we just institute our current policies, if we actually meet some of our emissions targets for 2030 or our longer term 2050 targets. So, for example, Australia has a net zero greenhouse gas emissions target by 2050 and other some other countries have similar targets, and then we would reduce the amount of global warming we would experience later this century. But to actually be consistent with the Paris climate agreement and keep global warming to well below two degrees Celsius or even 1.5 degrees Celsius, we need to follow a path like this. So we have this gap between where we're at and where we need to be. So we basically we just need to really reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. So but at the same time, we don't want to stall economic development. We don't want to store development, particularly in low income parts of the world which haven't had basically the opportunities that countries like Australia have had from using fossil fuels to generate economic growth and other kind of subsequent benefits. So we need to basically get down to net zero emissions to stop global warming, stop further global warming. But we need to do it without reducing opportunity. We don't want to go back to the dark Ages. So to understand how we do this, it's worth considering our greenhouse gas emissions. Um, what they're kind of composed of. So this is global greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 to the recent period by industry, so you can see that the largest individual sector is electricity generation and heating with electricity generation. We do have other ways we can generate electricity that don't use fossil fuels. We know that we can generate electricity from wind and solar. We don't actually need to use coal, oil and gas. We also, though, see greenhouse gas emissions from other sources where it might be harder to decarbonise, at least with current technologies. So, for example, aviation, which is a relatively small component of global greenhouse gas emissions but really a larger component in wealthier countries and wealthier people's free house gas emissions, Um, aviation is becoming more efficient through the use of planes that are lighter and just don't use as much fuel to fly the same distance. So, for example, some of you might be aware of the Boeing 787 s the Dreamliners they use much less fuel than a Boeing 747 does even per passenger. So we are seeing developments in aircraft that are reducing emissions per person. But we're seeing growth in the overall industry, which is why we're seeing growth in aviation emissions at least prior to the covid pandemic. Um, so we need to see further technological developments in these kinds of sectors. For agriculture, it's quite hard to decarbonise agriculture, but reducing meat consumption and increasing consumption of vegetables and fruits would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A lot of those emissions come from methane, some of that from things like rice paddies but also from livestock, so reducing livestock and meat consumption would be beneficial. One thing with agriculture is that it's methane rather than carbon dioxide emissions. Methane doesn't stay as long in the atmosphere, so there would be quicker benefits basically from decarbonising agriculture or anything we can do to reduce agricultural emissions. We would see benefits fairly quickly within a decade or two. Um, unfortunately, we have lots of emissions from things like concrete and cement production again, that's also becoming more efficient. But it still produces greenhouse gas emissions so concrete the greenhouse gas emissions associated with concrete production have gone down about a quarter since 1990 per unit concrete production. Fugitive emissions. Um, you might wonder what that means. That's basically from leaks. So it's actually really bad because it's not from actually using fossil fuels at all. It's just leaks from fossil fuel transport resulting in greenhouse gas emissions. So we need to kind of stamp that out again. That can be done with improved technology to identify leaks quicker and fix them up. So there are kind of what I'm trying to show here is that there isn't really one solution to tackling greenhouse gas emissions because we're emitting greenhouse gases in so many different ways across so many different industries. We need lots of different solutions. It's worth pointing out, though. You know, I've discussed the fact that global greenhouse gas emissions have increased, and that's really disappointing, but we're still we're we're basically we're still seeing increases in global greenhouse gas emissions. We're accelerating global warming. But individual countries are reducing their greenhouse gas emissions quite effectively, so that really shows that we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions on a larger scale across at least many regions of the globe. In Australia, we've seen we've probably passed peak greenhouse gas emissions, um, two or three years ago. But in other wealthy nations, we have seen big reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, particularly countries like Germany and the UK. Also, Canada is kind of following a similar path to Australia. These are kind of total emissions across these whole countries. The UK s population is more than double Australia's population and its annual greenhouse gas emissions are lower than Australians, so Australia could be a lot more efficient and produce far less greenhouse gas. If we were to adopt policies that some Western European countries have followed, it's worth pointing out, though, that the UK s emissions go much further back. That's where the industrial revolution started. So that's why we see these greenhouse gas emissions earlier in the UK than in other countries. So it's cumulative. Greenhouse gas emissions are higher than many other countries, including Australia. If you look at CO two emissions by industry in the UK, we've seen this complete collapse of the coal industry. Coal isn't used for electricity generation anymore. It used to be the main source of electricity generation, even back in the 19 sixties and even not that long ago. Even a decade ago, it was a major source of electricity. It's basically just gone down to zero. As renewable energy sources renewable electricity generation has taken over. Also, gas and oil emissions have dropped a lot in Australia. We have seen a reduction in coal emissions recently, but it's nowhere near the same scale and of course we still export coal for electricity generation in other countries. We basically need to stop doing that, reduce our impact on the climate system So by following the lead of some Western European countries, Australia could see further big reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. And it really is incumbent upon countries like Australia to take the lead on this. Um, you know, we can't really ask lower income nations that haven't had that don't have the same greenhouse gas emissions to decarbonise in the same way that you know, just because their cumulative emissions are nowhere near the levels of countries like Australia and even their annual emissions are much lower. So countries like Australia, the US European countries really need to take the lead on reducing CO two emissions as quickly as possible. And we have a lot of the technologies already available to do this as countries like Germany and the UK show, um, we also to actually get down to net zero, or preferably even net negative emissions and start cooling the planet again. We're going to need to capture and store carbon, and we are developing technologies To be able to do this. There are fancy instruments like this that scrub carbon out of the atmosphere and store it into the surface. We're going to need to be able to do this to actually stop warming the planet. So this will need to happen on top of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. At the moment, we can't do this very efficiently. This technology is being developed. It's improving, but it's not really there yet, so and it's very expensive to run at the moment. But as the technology develops, we can see some expansion of this as well as through careful land use, management and planting of trees in places that are climatic and suitable for those trees. We can also have natural stores of carbon, expand the natural stores of carbon and decrease carbon dioxide in the so in conclusion, from this lecture, we've talked basically about the ozone hole and compared it with climate change. The ozone hole. We went from discovery, identification of the problem to international agreement within a decade, and we've really stopped the problem getting worse. We haven't seen the ozone hole growing in the last 20 or 30 years because we took those actions. Humanity took those actions to stop the use of CFCs about 30 years ago, 35 years ago. Climate change. We just have not seen the same scale of action. There's a number of reasons why this is the case, but we understand the problem. We have many of the solutions in place. We need to further develop technologies to really enable massive emissions reductions. But we do have technologies in place to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. Already, there's no need really to generate electricity from non renewable sources now. So we need to really get on a proper track towards net zero emissions through existing technologies and further developments of technology to actually remove carbon from the atmosphere. Um, so I showed this slide right back in week one. This is the final lecture from the core content, and hopefully you feel like in the last few weeks you've kind of gained a general understanding of climate change and sustainable development beyond what you would have learned at school. Um, hopefully it's been of interest to you. Now, with the investigation starting from next week, you'll be able to go into a bit more detail focusing on a particular aspect of science related to sustainable development. Um, so just a reminder. We're in week five. Next week. You're going into your investigation. One first lecture. Um, so you won't be in this lecture at this time. Um And then, um yeah, later on your investigation to starting in week nine. So I'll leave it there. I'll see some of you in next week. If you're taking the climate extremes investigation, I'll be teaching the first two weeks of that. Um but otherwise, I hope you've enjoyed the first five weeks. Or at least, um, feel like you've understood climate change more than you did before. Um, yeah. So thanks for coming along.

SPEAKER 1
You did OK. Alright. Good.

SPEAKER 2
Um, it's probably easiest for me just to plug into your computer a plenty of seats from from this side.

SPEAKER 1
Don't feel shy to come forward. I know it's not a not a common thing to do. I used to sit at the back as well. So there you go. Do you sit at the back as well?

SPEAKER 2
We were probably one of the brightest in our class if we went on a PhD and everything. And the people are the ones who usually sit up the front. So yeah, that's why I sat at the back.

SPEAKER 1
You see, I can't remember it.

SPEAKER 2
There was only 30 students in my class, so I don't think it mattered much.

SPEAKER 1
Alright, I think we're, uh we're basically ready. Ready to go. Um so welcome, everybody. And, uh, to the I guess the first investigation lecture and the first live one last year. There weren't any live stream lectures this year. There are three. Although our investigation only has two because, uh, one falls on ANZAC Day, which is a university holiday, and it's been impossible to reschedule that one. So, um, uh, I might start by, uh uh, I guess introducing the team and it's quite a diverse team. There's, uh, quite a number of, uh, different disciplines represented on our team. So my name's, uh, Dave Phillips, and I'm a geochemist in in this building in the School of Geography, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. Uh, another one of the folk from this, um, school is, uh, Sandra McLaren. And then there's also Professor Professor Evan Bisky from chemistry, and he'll talk to you in the next lecture in the next live stream lecture. And then, uh, there's Professor Sandra Kentish who, uh, will take the second half of, uh, of this lecture and, uh, Sandra's from chemical engineering. And last but certainly not least is er Tim Werner, who's, uh, a spatial scientist, uh, also in the school of Geography, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. And he'll come and talk to you at the next lecture, and you can ask Ask him what a spatial scientist does. OK, Uh, right, I guess. Um hopefully everybody who's on the live streaming can, uh, can hear us. Uh, we're gonna use, uh, pale, which, uh, hopefully you're familiar with from Andrew's lectures. Um, everybody knows paddle it. Do we not know, paddle there, You know, palette. OK, so there's the, um, the QR code for palette. If, um, if you wanted to look at that and put some notes up, uh, I will try and check it from time to time to see if there are any notes from, um I guess the folk online. Alright, so let's perhaps get started. So hopefully everybody's got one of these. Um, I've put mine on mute, so my mum doesn't call me again. Um, everybody's got their mobile phones. Yes. And what other devices have you got? Computers. So these are all electronic devices, right? And, uh, So has anybody considered or wondered what goes into one of these? What are all the elements in one of these? Yes, you can. Some suggestions. What's in? What's in your phone? Lithium is in the phone where the phone is lithium. The battery? Yep. Anything else in your phone? any other elements? Silicon? Yeah. So software? Yeah. Yeah. Um, not. Not exactly an element, but certainly important. Otherwise the phones don't work. Anything else? Cobalt. Where do we find cobalt lines? Yes, and in the phone, in in the battery, in the battery term, In the battery. Cathode? Yes. Aluminium. Yeah. Alright, Well, depending on the, uh, make or model of the phone. Uh, most phones contain more than 30 different elements. And so this is a a para table of the elements, uh, colour coded to show you, uh, some of the different elements and what they're used for in in mobile phones. So, for example, if you look at the the top, the dark grey, uh, all the elements in dark grey are what's in the, uh, in in the in the glass in touch, the touch screen glass. Uh, the case. The ones in in purple or mauve. The microprocessor and chips are the some of the elements in blue gallium Masum, silica, phosphorus, uh, the vibration unit, neo dini, the battery. So there's your lithium, manganese, cobalt, nickel, cadmium and some rare earth elements. So it's more than just lithium in, in in some of those batteries and there's different types of batteries so that those mix of elements will change. Uh, circuit boards, uh, obviously elements like, uh, silver, platinum, tin aluminium, the connectors and the wires, molybdenum, copper speaker and microphone elements like tungsten. And then there's a whole lot of rare earths in the in in the screens that make the the colours in our screens. So a whole lot of different elements in, uh, in, uh, our mobile phones or our devices, our computers and you might think of perhaps even electric vehicles as devices. Um, is there any difference is Obviously, our phones don't have tyres or things like that, But, uh, a lot of the elements that are in all of these devices, uh, they have are are fairly common. Uh, and of course, many of the elements that are in here are also the key to a green energy future. And, uh, those examples include ones that you guys have already mentioned, like lithium and cobalt and copper and things called rare earth elements. Um, now you might see that I've put inverted commas in green and then and also in in I put the green energy future in inverted commerce, should I say. And, uh, the reason for doing that is that as we transition from a fossil fuel world to a green world, there's still a price to be paid right. We need to get, for example, the lithium and the cobalt and the rare earth elements from somewhere. And I've put up a link there to, um, a recent ABC Four Corners video called Digging In. Why Powering a green future means more minds because there's just not enough lithium being produced for him, for example, at the moment to cater for all the demand for lithium ion batteries going forward. And so there's an environmental and sustainability cost in going green. But I think most of us would probably feel that this is a cost worth taking to get away from a fossil fuel world which will kill the planet. Right. Otherwise, we need to throw away our mobile phones, right, and our other devices and, uh, electric cars and walk everywhere. You can't even take a bicycle because that's got some of these elements in it. All right, OK, so I have have a have a look at the, um, at the video on the on the, uh, l MS site. There's a whole lot of other links to a number of other videos. And, um uh, I guess some some reading some additional reading that, um that may be of interest. Alright, I'm I'm gonna start by giving you a very brief introduction, Then to what? We're gonna cover, um, throughout the investigation. And then I'll talk a little bit about lithium because everybody wants to hear about lithium. I guess it's one of the important elements. Uh, you can read that just as well as as me. So I'm not gonna, uh, read it all out. Uh, obviously, in week one and week two, we've got the two live and live streamed lectures such as today's, uh, and then the the rest of those titles There in black are online lectures. Uh, so we start with introduction. We look at properties and uses supply demand issues. In week two. We look at what minerals. We get those key elements from where they come from global mineral resources. And then in week three, we look at some of the environmental and social impacts of exploiting these, uh, elements and some of the mitigation strategies, strategies we might employ around engineering and environmental solutions. OK, then the workshops basically support, um, those lectures. So please make sure that you view all the lectures all the online lectures before you go to the workshops. Because what you do in the workshops, it'll be assumed that you've looked at the online lectures and also important for the assessment that you both attend the workshops and, um, the and watch the lectures, uh, the workshops in week One. Uh, you'll see there's a theme throughout the online lectures as well as the workshops. We'll be using cobalt as an example, uh, throughout. And so the first workshop will focus on on some of the aspects of cobalt properties. Uses supply demand. In Week two, we'll look at the different mineral deposits that contain cobalt, um, and some of the issues around cobalt. And then, in Week three, we'll really get into the environmental and social impacts of mining again with examples from cobalt as well as some mitigation strategies. Right. So this is the bit that I guess most of you are interested in. What's the assessment going to be about? So the assessment involves a group electronic poster. So you guys should have all been in groups by now. Is that right? Everything in a in a group? Yes. No, no. Well, if you're not, I guess talk to um yes, somebody. Somebody who is, um uh We were in a workshop

SPEAKER 3
together. You're in a workshop.

SPEAKER 1
Oh, I see. Ok, alright. Well, whatever group whatever groups, then you've been told to me. Ok, uh, and then each group, uh, you need to select a particular element or group of related elements to to focus on, uh, there's a lot of information on the assessment on the l MS. So again, have a look at, um at all that material, so you'll pick one, and then your poster, you'll discuss properties, uses supply, demand issues, the sources of these elements. Um, some of the social and environmental impacts and then potential mitigation strategies. So you'll generate a poster, and, um and then you guys will peer mark one and others at the end of semester. So fun and games, but at least you get to see other people's posters. All right. I'll just put up the, uh the the pad link again for anybody who might have, um, tuned in late. OK, so I'm gonna finish off just with a couple of slides, then on, uh, on lithium. Uh, lithium is, uh, an unusual element. It's number three in the periodic table. The only lighter elements are helium and hydrogen. Uh, and it has some very interesting properties. It's obviously a very low density mineral. It's highly reactive metal, and it is soluble in water. So there's about, um, or 0.17 pipe per million lithium in in the ocean. So there's a vast source of lithium. The problem is trying to get it out. It's, um that's the issue. OK, uh, a whole variety of uses for lithium, uh, the one that you obviously know about are the lithium ion batteries also used for metal alloys, glasses, ceramics and all sorts of industrial processes. And, uh, if you look at the uses in 2010, compared to 2022 you'll see they're very different in terms of the proportional uses. Uh, the use of lithium in batteries has increased over that those last 12 years, from 23% to 80%. So 80% of lithium produced now is used for batteries and perhaps no surprise everything we use these days as lithium ion batteries from the electric drill to the mower that you can buy Now that's powered by lithium ion batteries to, you know, uh, electric cars to all our devices. Uh, and obviously there's now proportionally less uses in some of the other spheres. But I guess the issue with lithium is that, um that change and and quite dramatic change in demand. Um, is, uh, putting a quite a strain on resources? Uh, and supply and demand. And so the prices have started to go up quite, um, quite dramatically, and it's expected that demand will increase by at least a factor of six in the next 10 years. Um, where do we get lithium from Brines and from Pegmatite? These are the main sources. Do you really know what a brine is? What's a brine? Yes, it's a solution. Yeah, or kind of solution. So the solution with a lot of solute in, like a lot of sodium chloride as well as, um, for example, lithium, uh, the pigment types and I and I'll. I guess I'll pass some of these around um, I'll talk about them in a bit more detail, but you can have a look at them as, uh as they go past. And I'll put that one down. OK, they're actually the same composition or they look very different. So we'll get to that in a in a in a minute. Uh, so lithium is is quite a rare element in in the Earth's crust. Uh, although it's much more abundant in the in the earth's crust than the the whole Earth. Uh, about point Oh oh, 2%. And to get it to a mable grade from mining minerals such as spine, which is one of the minerals that contains lithium and is mined, uh, needs to be about 10.9 to 1.6% lithium. OK, so I've put this up. Um, this is just showing you some of the production over the last few years. This comes from the United States Geological Survey data, and you can see the increase in demand or the increase in production of lithium, which basically, um, mirrors demand. And I've also put on here the, um production and and some of the countries that dominate production. The, um F in comparing 2013 to 2022 figures and then on the pie diagram on the right shows you some of the reserves. And as you can see, most of the world's supply comes from Chile with as well as Argentina and then from Australia. Most of the production from Chile and Argentina is from Brines. Most of the production from Australia comes from mineral deposits, which is what do you mean? OK, what are we doing for time? Right, So, as I say, two sources two completely different sources for lithium. Uh, lithium ions are basically form. They're found, uh, largely in, uh, the high elevation deserts in South America. And they form by in in basins around in valleys where we basically get water draining into these basins. A lot of sunshine. The basin, the water all evaporates, and we and we're left with these very thick salt deposits. And, uh, these salt deposits that contain small amounts of lithium and one of the ways that lithium is extracted is by pumping water into the salt flat and then and that dissolves the the the lithium into solution. And then it's recovered and put into these evaporation pans where it's evaporated until we increase the concentration enough to recover. Uh, the lithium the other way is, uh, from these things called pegmatite. Now one of the rocks that's going past is called the Granite, and it's the most common of the rocks on the earth in the Earth's crust. So how many of you have been to, uh, Wilson's prom? A few of you OK, so Wilson's prom is a great example of a of a nice, fresh, well exposed granite, uh, intrusion. So it's a it's basically a magmatic rock forms deep in the earth. Uh, and it forms in areas where, uh, the oceanic plates diving beyond the continental crust, such as in the in the area of the Andes. And, uh, you get melting when that happens, and that melts. Some of the rocks at the base of the crust forms these magnets called granite. They crystallise, and then the last fluids that get left in the granite kind of boil off. And they carry some of these rare elements with them, which don't get captured in the granite like beri and lithium. Being one of those, and they form in these little pockets, and they form very coarse grain rocks called pegmatite. And this is an image here of a coarse grain pegmatite that contains large spine crystals and that is the source of lithium from the mineral deposits. And then, of course, and they're fairly small bodies, and so the minds themselves tend to be fairly small. So if you're looking at environmental cost, what do you think? Which do you think is more environmentally friendly? I guess extracting lithium from Brines or from the mineral mines? Oh, we have a poll. How how many? How many people think it's, um, more environmentally friend to take them from the brines? OK, how many think it's more environmentally friendly to get it? Get the lithium from the mineral deposits? A few of you. But the majority have, said Brines OK, and Professor Kent is correct. It's it's much more. I I i it it's counterintuitive, but it's actually more environmentally sustainable or friendly to take the lithium from the mineral deposits. And and there's a few reasons for that. One of the main reasons is that, uh uh, the lithium brine deposits are in generally in desert areas, and you need a lot of water, and so they use a lot of ground water to, um to dissolve the lithium. So there's a a cost in terms of the water resources and then in processing. Uh, there are a lot of toxic chemicals that are involved in processing. And so, um, so that becomes an issue as well. And in fact, it's actually costlier to produce lithium from brines than it is from, um you mean mine? Uh, the main issues with this is obviously you know, you it's a blight on the landscape. But if it's rehabilitated properly, Um, it's, um it should be, I guess, less damaging environmentally, certainly less damaging than a coal mine. OK, so I might leave it there. And I'm gonna hand over to Professor Kentish who's going to Yeah, Yeah. Oh, OK, I'll we'll keep We'll keep talking, then. All right, um, so pragma type mines, the the mineral mines anyway, I I mean, there is, as I said, some environmental cost to to doing them as well. Uh, like any mine. Uh, it's, uh you need to give a big hole in the ground. And, uh, you know, there are obviously a lot of um, bad environmental stories about mines over the history. But, you know, it's it's I guess it's up to, uh, to your generation to, uh, make sure that we're able to exploit these things sustainably. Just a small challenge going forward. Um, all right, Anybody has any questions while, um, while we get started, I try and sort out the Yeah. Anybody. Any questions?

SPEAKER 2
Easiest to just put it on mine.

SPEAKER 1
The only question on the pad is how do we find our group members? We're not sure about that either. So I think the best thing to do is to talk to Alyssa or email Alyssa, if you're not quite sure. Um, do you guys all know Alyssa the No. OK, so Elissa basically organises the, um, the workshops, um, or I'll I'll put. I'll put, um, I'll put a a contact up on the on the l MS. How's that? Um, but if you've had if you've been working in groups before, then, um, my understanding was that you would continue with those groups. Um, going forward. All right. So anybody have thoughts about what element they might choose, or groups of elements. Anyway, we're gonna choose lithium How about rare filaments? That's that's a fascinating story. Rare earth elements. If anybody wants to tackle that one, that is really fascinating. Oh, are you? Oh, OK. No, I'm I'm just I'm just pulling into your left. The microphone? Yes. You tend to run off with these things, OK, so

SPEAKER 2
I'm gonna take things in a direction, but in in many ways, build on what Dave was just talking about. So I'm a chemical engineer, and one of the things we get involved in is how do you take, uh, a lithium or the rock that, uh, Dave just talked to you about and turn it into something that's viable? And a lot of this is in lecture fiver, which is online, uh, which you won't get to for three weeks. But because ANZAC Day, uh, screwed up everything. You're getting me earlier. So I'm not expecting you to have covered the material that's in the online lecture, But let's build on what Dave was just talking about. So he he talked about. You can get lithium from brine's, or you can get them from spine. I talk a little bit in my online lecture about getting it from brines, and it is an ugly process. So as, um, Dave just talked about you take it from, um an underground reservoir knows a saline aquifer. I didn't realise they pump groundwater in, so I've learnt something new. Ah, you pump it up and then you have to put it in this evaporation pond. And as Dave talked about, this is a pretty messy process because all that water you've just added, you're allowing to evaporate. Um, and so there's quite a huge energy demand, and you precipitate out a whole heap of salts that aren't lithium based. And you just leave them there basically, when they're doing this in South America. So you get this huge amount of waste. Um, you take those salt away, you evaporate a bit more, and then you add a huge amount of sodium carb, carbon eight, um, and that only when you add that sodium carbonate you precipitate out the lithium, uh, as lithium carbonate, and then you've got to go and process it further. So it is a very messy process. Um, it is, at the moment, environmentally unfriendly, but you'll see that even the spine process is pretty nasty. Uh, but Here's a picture of one of those sorts of mines and you can see you're dealing with, um, people in South America who are not highly skilled and their environment is basically being destroyed by this, Um, this this mining, uh, that's going on. And it is ramping up dramatically. As we saw it, Um, I would add again, I talk a little bit more in my online lecture about, um, approaches that we're developing here at the University of Melbourne. Um, so this is a process now where we're still taking that native brine. But rather than going through an ex a evaporation process, we contact the brine with a solvent. It's an organic liquid, so it doesn't dissolve in the brine, and the brine doesn't dissolve in the organic. But the organic liquid has a very strong affinity for lithium, and so you can pull the lithium out of the aqueous phase into the organic phase, um, and then extract it from there. So one of my colleagues, Professor Mumford, she actually has patent and is working with a company on this process where you basically extract the the lithium out using solvents. Um, and then you can uh, inject that. Um, spent brine back into the aquifer so you don't have the water demand. Um, and you don't have the crystallisation of those salts. Um, so that's, you know, certainly something very important for all of us is how do you make some of these mining processes more sustainable? Um, as we increase really ramp up production. Uh, but I wanna talk about you mean which is what's happening in Australia. Um, this is an overview of the process that is in lecture five A. So, uh, that's what you'll see when you get into lecture. Five A. Ah, but I wanna deep dive a little bit more into what's going on, so I won't I'll step you through that process. The first thing is to think about what's happening in Australia, and I saw Dave put up a slide saying 60,000 tonnes a year of current production. When I looked up the website, there's clearly potential to do more, so Pilbara minerals, uh, it says that they're producing 380,000 tonnes per year, so I don't know who's right. Uh Ah, OK, now this is chel. Probably talking the number of rocks they're mining. So and that's an indication of what's going on to 380,000 tonnes of rocks. You you don't get much, uh, lithium out of that. We'll talk a bit more about that. But there's a range of mines there. Pilbara Minerals is the biggest, uh, Lion Town Resources. Uh, there's a lot that are just starting up. So, uh, Lion Town Resources core lithium says they may produce over 15 million tonnes per annum. Uh, so there's a lot of activity, Um, and this last one green. Bush's mine is the one that Dave put the picture up of, uh, and they'll talk a little bit more about green Bush's mine, so there's a lot of mining happening. But most of these mines only do the first step, which is called Flotation. And again, my lecture five a goes into more of the science behind flotation, but it basically relies on differences in the density of the lithium, uh, containing crystals versus other components. But it does involve adding a lot of water. Um, so again, it's not to say that spine mining is environmentally friendly is not true. It's just slightly less environmentally friendly than getting it from a bride. Uh, so we go through a flotation step. Most of these mines, then they export the concentrate. They don't take it any further. Most of the further mining at the moment is going on overseas. Um, Japan, China places like that. Now, here's some questions for you. Uh, Dave put up briefly what? The concentration in the original ore was. Can any remember what the concentration of lithium oxide was in the ore as you mine it. Sorry. Zero point. You correct. 0.8 to one point. Something. One point. I can't even remember what you had up. I've I've around 1% was what I had in the back of my mind. And that's roughly what he put up. OK, after we've been through the flotation step, what do you think the concentration is? Anyone want to guess? Uh, give me a number 5%. Anybody else wanna go bid higher bid? Lower eight. I've had a call for 8%. Anybody else you guys know too much. Uh, after that flotation, it is, in fact, only 6% lithium oxide. This is one of my concerns from a a global warming point of view. There it is before you go through the flotation step. Most of it, as Dave alluded to, is silica and aluminium. So it's sand. Basically, if I can be as a non geologist, uh, it's three quarters of it is sand after you've, uh, p, uh concentrated it. It's still mainly sand, and at the moment we send that as 6% or in a ship overseas. Um, now there's some problems with that from a whole heap of range of reasons. But to me, cutting around a lot of rock for a little bit of lithium doesn't make a lot of sense. Now, the good news is that there are two companies now who are going the whole hog. Uh, you need to be producing quite a bit of lithium before it becomes economically viable to process it within the country. But there are two companies now who have started up, uh, processes to convert it through to battery grade lithium hydroxide in Australia. They're both in western Australia, and I was gonna use this map. But then I've realised there's people online, so maybe I shouldn't, uh, but the first one is, uh, in Bunbury which is somewhere around here from memory. Bunbury. Maybe it's up here, but it's around here, uh, on the map. Uh, and that's a, um, joint venture between an Australian company, Mineral Resources Limited, and Alba Male, which is an American company. And they're using all from the green Bush's mine that that Dave just put up. The second one is a joint venture between a Chinese company and an Australian company. Um, and that's a little bit further north, essentially a suburb of Perth called. So, um, it's you can call an outer suburb of Perth. Um, so they're the two ones. They both seem to be starting up just about the same time. I couldn't get any details on the first one. They don't seem to publish anything about what they're doing. Uh, but I've managed to get some details on the second one, so we'll look at a little bit about how they're particularly converting. Um, there's a picture on the left of the second one. You can see it's been built. It's, uh, it's a decent size facility. Uh, and on the right shows your diagram of some of the processing trains. So this is there's two lines, Uh, that look like this. If we get time, I'll talk a little bit about these vessels, but it's quite a structure. You can see. That's 20 metres in height. Um, so this is a big processing facility, but it is processing 48,000 tonnes per annum. Uh, through this facility, Um, so let's go through it and you'll see that it's particularly not environmentally uh, friendly. Uh, so the first step we talked about we've got the spine concentrate. We've used flotation to get it to 6% at some point, either before or after the flotation step. We have to grind it up. You've got to get down to a particle size less than a millimetre or 100 micron before you get enough surface area to really get hold of the lithium. And as you'll see when you go through lecture five A. There's a huge energy demand in breaking up rock. Um, I've heard, uh, numbers where it's 20% of the energy Demand of Australia is are currently used in breaking rocks because we have a big mining industry, but I don't know whether that number's right, but it's a significant energy demand goes into breaking up rocks, Uh, whether you use explosives or whether you use, um, anything else. So we do need to grind it up, and then we roast it at 1000 degree C. And all we're doing there is converting the SPD. You mean from one crystal form to another crystal form? Um, so it's it's it's not actually doing anything other than changing the make the the type of crystal into something that's a little bit easier to Lee, which is what they'll do later. And the device they use for this looks like this. Um, it's a rotating drum. Uh, see if I can get a better pointer. Um, so this drum rotates, the ore comes in here, and it essentially falls through gravity along the length of the drum as it's rotating around. And we're direct firing with natural gas. What are we gonna do when we stop using fossil fuels? How do you get to 1000 and 50 degrees C if you don't have fossil fuels? Any suggestions? Yeah. Go for it. Yeah. Uh, what would the coal What form of energy would the coil be using? Yeah, you can get electricity more in what they call an electric arc furnace. Don't ask. Quite ask me how it works. Uh, but it's quite hard to get electricity up to that temperature. I mean, you think about your radio, your heater, that some people, the old style electric heaters. Getting up to 1000 is pretty hard, but you can do it, uh, so we can use electricity. Um, can use quite a bit of renewable energy, but possible any other suggestions? What other? Yeah. Yep, yep. Correct. You can certainly use biogas, and I'm doing some research on biogas at the moment, working with a few companies on biogas. But the total amount of biogas will produce in this country will probably not even service the lithium industry because it's relies on agricultural waste. And there's not that much agricultural or food waste around. But biogas would be a very good option if you get hold of it. Third option. Come on. Who's been reading their newspapers recently? Yeah, go for it. Well, that's essentially your electric arc system. Um, because you could produce radiation is not a heat source in itself. It's produced from, um, things like electricity. Yeah, there's one other fuel you haven't thought of yet. Geothermal won't get to those temperatures, will it? Dave, you're a geo. Probably know about geothermal. Yeah, OK, yeah. Yeah. Uh, my understanding. G f m. When you only get to about 200 degrees C. Max, it's just not that hot. Um, come on. Somebody can do it. Yeah, up the back. Nuclear fission would be wonderful. Uh, that's not what I had in mind, but yeah, nuclear fusion would be even better. Uh, I don't see any nuclear reactors being built in the country in a hurry, but it's possible You still haven't got to the one I'm after. Yeah, go for it. Friction. No, that won't work. Uh, lightning? No, this is something much more feasible. If you've been reading your newspapers, you'd know about it. Yeah. Biofuel. Well, that's like biogas. Wonderful idea, but you're not gonna be able to produce enough of it. Um, again, if you're a good chemical engineer, we can talk about algal processing to produce biofuels, but you'll use them for flying aeroplanes before you'll use them for mining for using lithium. Uh, mining lithium. Come on. So what might be something? We what might be an element we can source in a more environmentally friendly measure that we can burn hydrogen. Thank you. Uh, so a lot of talk about the hydrogen economy, Uh, and, well, that pretty much the only advantage from my point of view of hydrogen is that you can burn it at high temperatures. So I think before we ever use it in our cars or to generate electricity, the sweet spot is using it for high temperature action so you can form it by splitting water. Um, through electrolysis. Um, again, you probably might need a bit of lithium in your electrolyzer. But, um uh, you generate some hydrogen, and you can burn that at a high temperature, but it's not straightforward. Uh, where What? Here's another question. Sorry. I'm gonna get really sidetracked here. Uh, what percentage of hydrogen do you think globally is currently produced from splitting water versus making it from fossil fuels? What percentage are we producing? Using splitting water at the moment roughly. Sorry. 5% for what are you? You're damn close. 96% of hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels at the moment, Only 4% from pretty well picked 4% from, uh, electrolysis. And that's because at the moment it's three times as expensive to make it from the electrolysis of water than it is from fossil fuels. So there's a bit of green washing going on when you talk about hydrogen Cos if you can make it out of fossil fuels, you will. But that's me being, um, too much of a greenie. Uh, we've roasted it. We've used, uh, some nice natural gas to do that. Then we're going to take it out. We're probably gonna dry. Well, it's it's it'll have dried out by that step. We're now going to add concentrated sulfuric acid at 25% of the ore. So for every tonne of ore, which remember is only 6% lithium, we're now gonna add 60.25 of a tonne of concentrated sulfuric acid. So this is not a particularly environmentally friendly process. It is better than the brides. Uh um and we're gonna leach it at 200 degrees C. Um, because we're dealing with a liquid. We can't use that same reactor, so we're gonna stick it in this reactor. Uh, this is again a rotating drum, But now like somebody just talked about. The energy is supplied externally. So we've got a heating jacket around it probably supplied with steam by the looks of that device. Um, when we've now got concentrated sulfuric acid in there at 202 150 degrees C. Those of you who studied chemistry at year 12, uh, is this is the sulfuric acid there as a liquid or as a gas or 200 degrees C. Can just That's what you all think, because water would be a gas at this temperature, wouldn't it? Uh, but this is 96 weight percent sulfuric acid, and it's actually a liquid at 200 degrees C. It doesn't boil until 300 degrees C. Uh, but you can see again. We're dealing with a very dangerous mixture. If anything else, you've got this really concentrated sulfuric acid running around in the drum at 202 150 degrees c. So not a straightforward process. And that converts the lithium oxide, though that's there into lithium sulphate, um, and soluble it so it now becomes it enters into the sulfuric acid phase. If you like. What are you gonna do next though it's, um, still mixed in with a lot of rock. Um, and if you filtered it now, you'd leave behind half your lithium, so you wash with water for an hour at 80 degrees C. Um, and then we're going to, um, philtre it and we'll take out the silica, the sand and the aluminium. Um, so we get rid of most of it at this point, uh, that, you know, 60 70% of silica and aluminium, and we end up with what's referred to in the industry as a pregnant liquor. Um, just for those of you going on in the mining industry, it's always been called a pregnant liquor. Uh, regardless of any, uh, you know, what do you call it? New age? Um, feminism. It's referred to as a pregnant liquor. Uh, and it's pregnant because it contains lots of lithium. Um, now this next slide, I've basically taken straight from the Quan refinery diagram, so it's a bit of a full page, but what do we do next? We take that pregnant liquor, Um, and we first of all evaporate it to re to remove some of the water. Uh, but we also then add a bit of sodium carbonate and a bit of sodium hydroxide to basically shift the P H up to an alkaline level. So again, more nasty chemicals. Um, that doesn't do anything to really to the the lithium or the sodium. We still Well, I suppose we we're still just adding more o h molecules, but the lithium and the sodium. So So we're essentially converting lithium sulphate and lithium hydroxide, uh, and the sodium hydroxide into Sorry. Yeah, sorry, we're forming sodium sulphate. Um, they're both soluble. All you're doing at the moment is getting rid of a whole heap of other impurities that don't that at this stage precipitate out. So when you go alkaline, uh, all the impurities such as iron, magnesium mag, all those, um, precipitate out so you can philtre them off. So we've now got something that is purer but is still pretty nasty. Still pretty un not 99% grade, which is where we're aiming eventually. Now, this is the interesting stuff, the sodium sulphide at this point. And I did steal this diagram from a website. Talking about the process in Quan is known as Globo salt because sodium sulphate is known as Glaber salt. Um, and at the moment, there is a market for Globus salt. As we increase the demand for lithium, one of our problems is going to be that we'll run out of demand for sodium sulphate, so this will become a waste. But at the moment, you can sell the glob of salt. Um, so to do that, you take your liquid. That actually also contains the lithium. You cool it down until the globus salt, the sodium sulphate precipitates, so you get a precipitate, a solid that is sodium sulphate and the lithium hydroxide still in solution. You then go through another centrifuge and another filtration step. And then we've got two products coming out of this a solid and a liquid. The solid is the glob of salt the top of the next row. I'll use my pointer for the people who are online. Um, so the glo of salt was a liquid? No, sorry, it was a solid, But you now dissolve it back up again. Why would we do that? Why would we, uh, dissolve it back up again? Basically, because it wasn't pure enough the first time round? Uh, so we've now got to put it through another step. We recrystallize it. But during that process we leave behind more impurities in the liquid phase. So we get something that is pure enough to sell. So we then go through a a separation step again. We dry it, and we've got sodium sulphate that the moment we can sell as a viable product. When I looked it up, what do you think the major use is of sodium sulphate? Anyone want to guess? I don't really expect. You'll get this one. It's a filler in your laundry detergent when you next wash your clothes. Apparently half of it is sodium sulphate, Uh, but that will obviously be a fairly limited market. There's only so many clothes we can wash. Uh, so again, an emerging problem as we ramp up lithium production is we've either got to change this process to use fewer chemicals, or we've got to find something to do with sodium sulphate because essentially, we're going to end up with. If you look at this reaction here, you're gonna end up with what is it? One sulphate molecule for every two lithium that you extract something like that, um, the lithium hydroxide was in the liquid phase again. We need to further purify that. So we crystallise it, we centrifuge it out and, um, thicken it will thicken and then centrifuge. Then we dissolve it back up again, Uh, crystallise it again and then dry it. So we eventually end up with 99% lithium hydroxide. Um, do you think it's environmentally friendly? It's pretty nasty, isn't it? Um, but I suppose we've got to accept that this is the mining industry. My big argument with this is it goes in your car. I actually have an electric car. Mine's currently 2.5 years old. It's probably gonna last another at least 10 years. So while getting that lithium out is not very environmentally friendly, I've got something that will last for 10 or 20 years. Converse that with coal mining, for instance. You dig it up. It's also got a lot of en environment or coal. Seam gas is probably a lot worse. Um, you burn it, it's gone in minutes. Um, and you keep consuming it. So this is a fairly nasty operation. But it's one that is, um, something that you can uh, do that has a relatively long lifetime. Yeah, not in the lead. Acid batteries, if you go to my lecture. Six a. Which I was just gonna talk about. There's a little couple of slides on recycling of lead acid batteries because that was the other thing I wanted to mention is that ultimately we should get to a point where recycling of lithium becomes can account for a significant portion of the market. Um, and if you when you look at my lecture six a on recycling. Um, the problem at the moment is nobody is handing in their mobile phones for recycling. So, um, there's a statistic in there, something like there was 3000 tonnes of lithium thrown out last year because we all bought new mobile phones and only 60 tonnes of it got recycled. Um, so but if you are, if you think about it, we just said lithium or 1% lithium. If you take your mobile phone, what percentage of lithium do you think is in your mobile phone, Dave? More than 1%. 5% maybe. Yeah. Um, what I'm getting at is gonna be easier to get it back out. of your mobile phone than it will be to get it out of the ground. Uh, if it's there in awe of 1% because once you take away the glass and the stuff that's fairly easy to get rid of, it will be there as a more concentrated material. It's still dilute. But if we can get the recycling going, then we can cut the amount that we need to mine. So because then, like if a company like one company

SPEAKER 3
in Australia just really started coming here, yeah, and so

SPEAKER 2
again when you look at my lecture. Six A. There is a company in Melbourne doing called Enviro Stream. Um, and they they're already started doing it, but and and Tesla are very keen to do it. But you get back to the problem with a lot of recycling, which is collection is half of the problem, so Melbourne Uni here will take your e waste. Every local council in the country will take your e waste. Getting the energy up for you to go and put your mobile phone in the e waste bin is still proving difficult, but you're right. Eventually, what you do is you actually need the same as on your glass bottles when you you return your bottles in South Australia at five cents back. And they're gonna do that here in Victoria. Um, I think that's what we'll need is to say, if you hand your mobile phone in, we'll give you a dollar. Um, might get it started, but that's I'm as bad as anybody else. We've got a stack of mobile phones sitting in a little bag ready to be recycled, and we've never got around to recycling them. Um, anyway, I am coming to the end of my time or I have come to the end of my time. Any other questions for Dave or myself? Uh, on the other day, if you want to add anything towards next lectures or anything, any other questions, they go. They're all packing up. You better be quick.

SPEAKER 1
No, that's all good. Um, thanks, everybody for, uh, for coming today and listening to us. And we hope that you enjoy the, uh, the investigation and putting together your posters. Uh, if you have any questions, um, feel free to ask me. These are now at all online.

SPEAKER 2
That is true. I had more, but that's that was enough.

SPEAKER 3
Yes. Were you working in groups before? In terms of the other workshop?

SPEAKER 1
Um, I'll tell you what. I'll talk to Alyssa over all the workshops, and, um, I'll I'll ask her the question and she can respond to you.

SPEAKER 3
Yeah, I Yeah, I don't know.

SPEAKER 1
I don't know if there are rules about groups, and so I don't want to tell you one thing. And then and this beats me down and says, No, you shouldn't have told her that. So let me talk to her and and I'll go back to you, OK? Yeah. Yeah. So I'll I'll let you guys know I'll put something up on the right that seem to go. OK, I wonder what happened to my pigment to it. Otherwise I'll see you. Yeah, thanks.

SPEAKER 2
Oh, hi.

SPEAKER 3
That was Well, they've still got the energy in the Yeah, um I think that's out of the class of about 100 who actually are enrolled. Thank you. I do still have that Excel projections. I have not put that this time, but I can put it to I will do that and I will tell them not to play with that until they submit their review so they don't have to. But I still have copies of that from the last years. How's everyone today? We've got no one turning up. Is it because there's a review tonight? And people just want to kind of do the revision and a lot of as well, What's that? Oh, OK, I'm

SPEAKER 1
you can sort of ask questions like maybe I can try and answer them as time goes by. I'm not sure this technology will work, but hopefully it will. So, uh, just scan that quickly if you possibly can. And, uh, we'll see how it goes. OK, so let's, uh, uh, look at a brief biography of lithium. So lithium comes from lits uh, which is stone in Greek. It's the third element in the periodic table, so it's a light element. Uh, it's metallic conducts electricity as a metal silvery white in. Appearance explodes when you add it to water. So I don't know. At high school, you probably had the old teacher Chuck the lump of sodium into water, uh, where you can do the same with lithium. If you throw it into water, it generates hydrogen, which explodes, so it's it can be a spectacular material. Uh, it has two isotopes So there's lithium six and lithium seven, and the more abundant isotope is lithium seven and lithium. Six has three protons and three neutrons in the nucleus. Lithium seven has three protons and four neutrons in the nucleus. And you might think, Why have you got these two isotopes? Well, it comes about because of the way that lithium was formed, essentially in astronomical processes, and we'll look at that in a minute. Uh, it's a light metal, so it is has a density of 0.5 grammes per centimetre cube, so it's lighter than water. It's about half as light as water, so it would float on water. And that means that it's actually useful for making all alloys so strong. Alloys can be made by combining lithium and aluminium, so that makes, uh, a stiff and light metal. And that's useful in aerospace applications. So, for example, in the space shuttle or missiles or rocket ships or things like that, and that would have been one of the the larger uses of lithium. Uh, until recently, where its electrochemical properties began to be exploited. Uh, it's got a relatively low boiling point of about 100 and 80 C. And, as I said, it forms salts, things like lithium chloride. And nowadays it costs about 60 bucks for a kilogramme, and, uh, in comparison sodium costs around $25 per kilogramme, so sodium's cheaper than lithium. And that sort of reflects the abundances of those materials and the costs for refining the materials. OK, so as most of you probably know, you can arrange the elements in the periodic table. And you know, the first row is hydrogen helium, and then the very next element is lithium. It's the first element in the second row of the periodic table, so it has three electrons. Uh, and you know, one of the interesting things about elements and this is going off topic a little bit is that, you know, elements were formed or are formed in stars, and all of the elements up to iron can be formed in stars like the sun. But after iron, then it gets, um, sort of more difficult for stars to form those elements. So many of the heavier elements are actually formed in processes like supernovae. So, you know, gold, for example, uh, isn't formed in a star like the sun. It's the result of a supernova explosion in many cases that happened long ago in a far, far away place. So interesting to think of the way in which elements are formed. Uh, so where does lithium come from? Well, there are four main processes, and, you know, all of this is debated. It has something to do with nuclear physics and astronomy. So some lithium was made in the big bang. So right at the beginning of the universe. As people now think that it began, uh, there was formation of hydrogen and those hydrogen atoms, could or hydrogen nuclei could combine together to give helium nuclei, which could in turn, uh, come together to give lithium and BERI so the lightest elements. So those lightest elements were formed first. But it's actually, um, difficult to make lithium in the big bang. So if you try and work out how much lithium there should be from the big bang, there's not enough to account for the amount of lithium that there is in the universe. So it's formed by other mechanisms as well. So one of the other mechanisms is that there are heavier elements drifting around in space or in stars or whatever, and cosmic rays come along and break them up. And some of the fragments are lithium atoms. So that's another way that you can make it lithium in the universe. And that process is called cosmic ray Spill. Uh, another way is that in certain stars it is possible to make lithium, but the conditions have to be fairly specific. It has to be a particular sort of star, so it's not very efficient in a star like our sun, and another way is in white dwarf stars. So there the conditions are such that lithium is formed. But it is still a matter of sort of debate, uh, as to how we have as much lithium as we do have and why we have the sort of isotopic abundances that we have. So if you look at the abundance of lithium in our solar system and that would include lithium in the sun, then you can see that lithium is here and there's way, way more hydrogen. This is a logarithmic scale on the Y axis. And so there's something like, uh, 10 to the 10 or um, 10 to the nine times as much hydrogen in the solar system as there is lithium in the solar system. And there's about 1000 times as much sodium in the solar system as there is lithium in the in the solar system. So you know, in relative terms, there's not a lot of lithium around the place in the solar system. Alright, so let's look at the chemistry. Um so lithium has formally an electronic structure where by there are two electrons in the one s orbital and I don't know whether this makes sense to you, but generally, nowadays we sort of think of atoms as having an electronic structure, and the electrons essentially have to be associated with some sort of wave function. And the one s wave function is a sort of spherical wave function, and it's sort of close to the nucleus. So two electrons can be accommodated in that one s orbital, and one electron is in the two s orbital. So again, it's a spherical orbital, but it's distributed sort of further away from the nucleus. And that one electron, that single electron in the two s orbital is the Valence electron. So it's the one that would sort of be responsible for the bonds that lit lithium would tend to form, uh, so that electron in the two s orbital because it's sort of away from the nucleus, is relatively easily removed. So the ionisation energy is 5.4 electron volts. So again, I don't know whether that means anything to you, but, for example, a hydrogen atom. In order to rip the single electron away there, it's 13.6 electron bolts so way, way easier to rip that ele first electron away from lithium than it is from a hydrogen atom. Um, so it tends to form salts things like, uh, lithium hydroxide, uh, lithium chloride. So that would sort of be the analogue of sodium chloride that stuff that you probably put on your food but probably shouldn't put on your food. Uh, and that's, uh, a a lattice type structure where you have small lithium atoms, uh, nozzle between, uh, chloride ions. So it's lithium ions and chloride ions. OK, so that's a regular periodic lattice, and that's, you know, a relatively stable sort of material. Um, so lithium is actually or lithium, plus the the essentially the, um, iron that is in lithium chloride is small, so it has an atomic radius of 90 Picco metres, so that is 90 by 10 to the minus 12 metres, so pretty small. So in comparison, sodium plus sodium ion has an atomic radius of 100 and 16 Picco metres and you know salts dissolve in water and so if you dump lithium chloride into water, then you end up with lithium plus ions and chloride ions. And the reason that you have salvation is that water molecules like to get around those positively charged lithium ions and the negatively charged chloride ions. And so the water molecules arrange themselves so that in the case of the lithium, it's the negatively charged oxygen bit of the water that nuzzles up against the lithium plus. And for the chloride ion, it's the positively charged hydrogens, which wanna nuzzle up against the chloride. OK, so it's really that interaction with the solvent molecules, which leads to the solubility of lithium chloride. OK, so what's lithium doing in batteries? Well, all batteries consist of a cathode, an a node and an electrolyte. So essentially there's one electrode, which is n as the a node. And there's a material which is an electrolyte which contains mobile ions, and an an another electrode, which is a cathode. And essentially you can have current flowing from the A node through some sort of load, which could be a light bulb or a motor or a transistor. Anything at all something that, um, that you can, uh, use that current to do some sort of work. Eventually, the current comes back to the cathode. So essentially you're liberating electrodes at the A node and bringing them back around to the cathode, and they're flowing through something which enables you to do some sort of work or perform some sort of function. OK, so in lithium batteries, the electrolyte generally or is oftentimes lithium hexafluoride, which are lithium ions, And this counter, uh, which has a phosphorus and six, uh, fluorine atoms around it. So this is positively charged. This is negatively charged. Uh, the A node is actually graphite. And that graphite has, uh, I Usually it's a porous form of graphite, and it's such that the lithium atoms wanna come and bind onto the graphite. So it's really the high, uh, absorb of that graphite, which leads to the high capacity of lithium ion batteries. So one lithium atom can essentially combine together with six carbon atoms in that graphite. Um so the structure of that, or or the microstructure of that a node is important. It needs to be porous, sort of high surface area material and the cathode. The electrode on the other side is some sort of metal metal oxide, and at the moment it's, um, one of the favoured metal oxide is essentially lithium cobalt, uh, oxide. So that's where cobalt comes into lithium iron batteries. And essentially, what you have is electrons being taken away from the a node liberating lithium plus, which comes across the cathode and recombines with electrons on that side. OK, so electro chemically, this is what it looks like. There are two reactions. There's an a node reaction and a cathode reaction. So the a node reaction is one where you have lithium with, uh, six carbons, uh, essentially liberating the lithium plus and an electron. The electron flows around the circuit. The lithium plus moves through the electrolyte towards the cathode and at the cathode, you have the lithium plus, combining with the cobalt oxide, an electrode and an electron to make the lithium cobalt oxide. OK, so the overall reaction for that cell you get by adding those two, Um uh a node and cathode reactions. So that gives you the overall reaction. So this is the way things would run if you had a discharge of that cell. That's as if you are actually getting power out of the cell. If you want to charge the cell up, you, uh, run the current in the reverse direction and you would run these reactions in the reverse direction and drive all of the lithium back onto the A node. OK? And again, it is the fact that that a node can absorb a lot of lithium, which, uh is the real key to the capacity of lithium ion batteries. OK, so it all comes down to performance and the performance criteria are energy density. So you want to be able to store a lot of energy per kilogramme. You don't want some big, lumpy battery. You want something that's light and mobile. OK, so lithium ion battery can store about 100 to, you know, around 250 watt hours per kilogramme, so watt hours is sort of power. Times time. Um, so it really is something that corresponds to energy. OK, in comparison, a lead acid battery. The thing that usually is used to start your car is sort of heavier. So they typically have, um, densities of 50 to 100 watt hours per kilogramme. So you need a chunkier lead acid battery to do the same job than a lithium ion battery. Uh, but in comparison, if you looked at petrol, uh, that's giving you 13,000 watt hours per kilogramme. So there's a lot of energy per kilogramme in petrol and hydrogen gas. There's 40,000 watt hours per kilogramme. But, um, you know, to get a kilogramme of hydrogen gas into a reasonable space, you've got to compress it to, um, very, very high pressure. So you really have to liquefy it. Otherwise, you end up going around the place with an enormous balloon dragging behind you. So it's hydrogen isn't so convenient in some sorts of ways. OK, so another performance criteria is recharge ability. You want to be able to recharge the battery, and nowadays from lithium-ion batteries, you get five years 2000, uh, cycles, which is pretty good. The other thing that is really important nowadays. If you want to drive a car around the place or charge, your phone is the speed at which you can recharge that battery. Uh, and you know, nowadays, I guess it's getting down to 10 minutes or whatever. But, you know, it's another thing that people really are working at to try and improve improve batteries so that the recharge rates can, uh, get higher. Uh, another issue is safety. So probably all of you have heard of lithium batteries, um, bursting into flames and causing catastrophe and mayhem. And so, you know, again, you have to worry about fire and toxicity. Um, and lastly, in terms of performance, you want, um, low costs in terms of production. But also you want low environmental costs and social costs. So they're the sort of criteria, Um, and you know, things are sort of going OK in a sort of a way, but, you know, then it's not. It's not perfect in the sense that you know, Where do you get that lithium from? It needs to come from a mine somewhere is you know, we obviously have finite reserves of lithium in the world in order to access the those reserves. There are, you know, environmental costs. Um, so you know, there are lithium shortages which are affecting the, um, desired transition to electric cars, for example. So you might ask, Why lithium, Why don't we make sodium batteries? So if you go back and look at the periodic table lying just below lithium is sodium, and there's a lot of sodium around the place, so the oceans are full of, um, sodium chloride, so, you know, way, way cheaper. Um, so sodium ion batteries are a hot area of research. People are trying to make them, and structurally, they sort of look like lithium ion batteries. So you again have a carbon a node, which absorbs sodium ions. Uh, one of the difficulties is it can't absorb as many sodium ions as it would lithium ions because sodium ions are larger and it ends up that the sort of chemistry is subtly different with sodium and things don't work as well. So the advantage are advantages are that sodium is much cheaper and more abundant than lithium. So you know it's 1000 times more abundant, at least around in in the solar system and probably excessively on on Earth. Way more abundant than that. Uh, and it has similar similar chemical and physical properties, and the disadvantages are that you end up with lower energy densities than lithium ion batteries, so you can store less energy per kilogramme. Uh, and there's a rapid voltage drop with discharge. So you start using the battery. In the case of lithium, then the voltage sort of remains fairly constant, as you, uh, discharge the battery. And you can see that in this graph here. So this is a plot of essentially the voltage of a battery against its capacity. And over on the right side, here on this blue curve here is essentially a lithium ion battery that's charged to full charge. And as you discharge it, you're going back in this direction here. And so you know the capacity is going down, but the voltage stays up relatively high. Whereas for a sodium ion battery, nowadays this is a sodium ion battery at full charge, and as it begins to discharge, the voltage starts to drop and it sort of drops in little steps. And so that makes it a more a less useful device than a lithium-ion battery. So people are, you know, working desperately to try and make sodium ion batteries that mimic the performance of lithium ion batteries. But they certainly haven't gotten there yet. But, you know, for some applications, maybe sodium batteries would work If you don't actually have to move the batteries around the place, it doesn't matter so much that they're heavy. So if there are, if they're a battery bank, that is always going to be sitting in one place, it doesn't matter if they're lumpy, but certainly if you want to use them, um, for this sort of application, um, then you want them to be light. So if you want to read more about sodium ion batteries and lithium ion batteries, um, in terms of their the chemistry and the the material science involved, then maybe you can look at this paper here. So it's in a journal called a CS chemistry letters. Um, and it's published two or three years ago. And it, um it does give, you know, a technical evaluation of those two forms of batteries. OK, so that's, um, me. So let's, um let's hear more about the interesting social and environmental side from Tim. Yeah, you can just You can just whack this into yours, I think. And you? There's a point in there.

SPEAKER 2
Thank you. Oh, I got a really, really managed to. All right. Thanks. Right. OK, Yeah. Hi, everyone. Um, so so far, in previous lectures, you've you've learned a lot about the importance of a variety of different resources. You learnt about things like geological processes that lead to a concentration of different resources in mineral deposits. Uh, you cover things like technologies and processes that are used to extract minerals from the ground and process them into more refined, usable products. And then you've covered things like, uh, chemistry and physics just then. Now we're going to build your understanding about what impacts can arise out of this process. So we're starting to recognise that. Yes. You do need minerals for a range of important applications. Our lives are built around the supply and use of different minerals. Um, but they have to come from somewhere and at some cost. So how do we try and understand these costs and start to make uh, decisions around how we actually supply these these materials in future. So, um, we'll talk about, like, what are some of the risks we face as a society just to get some of these materials? And, um so we think of in terms of environmental, social and governance, E S G. You might hear that a lot. Um, and these kind kind of pillars, the environmental aspects, social aspects, go aspects form this idea of sustainability, what is sustainable is not sustainable. Unless it's environmentally sustainable and socially sustainable and sustainable in a in a governance kind of perspective and also, um, economically sustainable. I'll talk a little bit about lithium mining and then provide some ideas, some solutions for what we might think of as responsible mining. So what, uh, what kind of risks do we face in mining? Here are some of the typical sort of issues that need to be considered for mining any any material we need to think about. What are the environmental impacts of of mining? So we can split that into aspects like water quality, um, ecosystems and vegetation. So, are we mining in the middle of the Amazon rainforest, or are we mining in the middle of the desert. There's gonna be different kind of, uh, education and ecosystem considerations. Um, how much land is required? What kind of impacts? The soil quality? Um, do you need to consider? Then there's the economic side of things. If a mineral deposit, it could be extremely rich. But if it's too far under the ground or it's underneath the city or whatever, it's just not economically viable. So the resource may as well not be there. Um, so you absolutely have to consider the cost. Then there's the social aspect. If you have communities that are so opposed to a mining project, um that they that very often there there can be huge conflicts. There can be violence, um, which then feeds back into the cost of the project. It's not sustainable. Um, and so I'm sure you've all seen Avatar. Um, it's this exact story. Um, if you don't have the buy-in of the community, um, you you you might have a wonderful resource of lithium in a certain location, but it's just not feasible to get there, uh, to extract it. Rather, um, these are this is kind of a nice summary of what mining companies will typically focus on when trying to manage a mine site. They very often focus on water, biodiversity, waste and emergency preparedness and response. Mining industry cares a lot about safety well, particularly in Australia, not necessarily in all parts of the world. Um, so that's kind of their their bread and butter the bread and butter of, um, mine managers. Um, and very often these requirements to consider these aspects are determined by local legislation. There are certain water quality guidelines that they have to adhere to. There's rules around impacts on endangered species. There's rules around Uh uh what, uh, waste you can dispose of and how and how you contain it. Um, and there's entire fields of research dedicated to managing each one of these aspects just to unpack a little bit about the kind of risks that are that are faced, um, are the kind of complexities that can be faced in terms of water. This is on the right, the Cowell gold mine in western Australia. It just so happens that the gold deposit sits underneath Lake Cowal, and so to access it, they have to dig a great big hole on the right. Um and because they're digging well below the water table. They have to constantly pump water out in order to keep the the the pit open. That's where they have water evaporation ponds. And you can imagine that would completely disrupt the the groundwater in this in this region, once they process the the gold, they have these great big tailings dams, which is basically a a waste storage facility where they again try and evaporate water and dry out the waste. Sometimes when you're, um, digging up a lot of soil and and exposing it to rainfall, you can dig up, um, sulfuric, uh, materials. Um, And when rain falls on them, they can leach out, uh, sulfuric acid When that gets into waterways, Uh, you can have, um, iron precipitate. And so you get this sort of rust colour in some rivers, and this is a classic hallmark of mine. Associated. Uh, pollution. It's called acid mine Drainage. Um, it Yeah, this is an example of, uh, the King River in the town of Queenstown in Tasmania. Um, where you have this this sort of really stark orange rust colour. Um, another issue they face in in this area is that because of a history of nearly 100 years of, uh, processing metals around Queenstown. Air pollution in this area led to a lot of, um, acid rain, which has kind of led the whole landscape in the surrounding areas to have this sort of be totally barren of vegetation. And this is in an area that is otherwise very lush, uh, northern Tasmania. Um, So there's this sort of, um, this sort of moonscape that's that's quite famous around Queenstown. But interestingly, on the social side of things, this moonscape is actually quite liked by the residents who've who've lived with mining for generations. And so it's this sort of weird situation where, yes, you've got a huge amount of pollution, but they sort of view it as a part of their heritage in terms of land. So thinking about what kind of footprint do mines occupy? This is the Grand Kara House project in Southeast Parra in Brazil. Um, and it's an example that demonstrates many of the sort of land related issues at play. So this this site, it's basically sitting in the middle of the Amazon rain forest. It's contributed to a lot of land clearing leading up to the mine. You can see that there's, um, lots of roads needed to, uh, to access the site and remove materials, and they fragment the habitat. And, um, areas adjacent to roads uh, typically have lower biodiversity than areas sort of deeper or further away from from cleared zones. Um, so obviously you've got a huge amount of land clearing here. Um, this is an extremely biodiverse region. Um, but interestingly, in granting this mining concession, the Brazilian government, uh, in order to sort of give approval and and get a bit of community buy in, they established 800,000 hectares of protected areas and indigenous reserves. So these kind of rebound effects they They're quite uncommon, but but they should they should be accounted for. But then, on the other side of things, the construction of this site also contributed to the development of a railroad that would then go on to support pig iron and cement factories that rely on charcoal. And in turn, this charcoal is linked to around 1.5 million hectares of lost forest. So that's significantly more than was set aside for conservation. So you can see that mining is not just happening in isolation. It can contribute to a whole series of land use change processes and economic and social change in a region that leads to a sort of explosion of different effects on landscapes. Um, and so how do we think about the impacts of a metal in this context? So this supplies iron that iron is goes off somewhere to produce steel, and that steel is then used in in a building. If someone in that building says, what is the impact of this building, they would they they would have to trace back through the whole supply chain and think about all the complex sort of impacts that are arising all the way back to the mine. Um, so this is this is just to say that there are There are many complicated contexts in which mining takes place, and it can be really hard to just try and understand. What is the impact of of our consumption? What is the impact of of the of our purchasing decisions? How what is the impact of of this laptop? For example, there are so many metals that come from so many different supply chains. Uh, can be virtually impossible to try and track what the impacts might be, Um, and and just to to think about the different kinds of of impacts that we might need to consider, uh, we can have a look at, um, Broken Hill. So here we've got mining in an urban context. We've got a city surrounding the mines we have mining in desert regions. Um, we have mining in mountainous regions. We have m, uh, mining right on coastlines. Um, and here I've kind of colour coded the different features of a mine just to highlight, um, that that you've got the same features present at each site. But they have very different impacts. So the the light blue is the tailings dam for this gold mine here. They don't have a tailing stand because they dump it directly into the ocean so we can't actually see it. Um, but for sure, there's there's going to be impacts on local marine life, So take that idea and think about OK, here's where, uh, the active metal and energy mineral mining sites are around the world. So many, um and so we can look at at at different metals that we use in society and think about OK, where are all the the rare earth mines in the world where all the lead, zinc or Indian are bearing mines around the world? And what does that mean in terms of environmental impacts or the different contexts under which these mines will operate? Just to add some more complexity to this, each of these sites are going to undergo different climate changes in future. So if we've got some areas that might experience more water stress in future mines, use a huge amount of water in their processing. So if you've got lots of, uh, copper mines in Chile, for example, um, in quite arid areas, uh, climate change models suggest that some of these areas are going to experience a lot of, uh, water stress. And so mining companies are already considering building things like water desalination plants just to feed into their minds and ensure that we get, uh, enough copper for our electric vehicles and what not? Hi. And when you map, uh, mining areas versus different, um, classifications of protected areas, uh, you could see that that quite a large, um, there's quite a large overlap between where mining is and biodiversity conserve, uh, conservation priorities. So moving forward, we as a society will face a dilemma where we have to make some really hard decisions. We want to solve global environmental problems by electrifying our our vehicle fleets. But at the same time, we cannot help the fact that a lot of mineral deposits just happen to overlap with areas of biodiversity conservation priorities. So how do we resolve this idea of maybe having local zones of sacrifice in order to solve global environmental problems? So for each site that we operate in future, there's going to be a lot of, um, factors that we have to weigh environmental perspectives, economic perspectives, social perspectives, and so on. Think about trends over time. So, um, what is really interesting is that when you look at what resources we have left, what mining companies are telling us is that we're not running out. Um, so often there is this kind of dialogue that are they they're limited, they're finite resources. And yes, they are finite. But over time, discovery has been outpacing production, and we are continuing to produce more over time. So this leads to more waste more energy consumption. Uh, more water, more land, more pressure on ecosystems. So far, we've not reached this sort of idea of there being peak minerals. Um, it is quite likely that there will be constraints around waste around, uh, social, uh, social impacts that are more likely to prevent a project going ahead and more likely to restrict supply than the actual discovery of resources under the ground. So this is this is just to say that the the environmental, the human side of things are a bigger issue to overcome than geological scarcity. Um, normally, I would give this lecture with my colleague Anna Kabaa, who now, um, works for, um, Transparency International. And, um, she she sort of covers very much the human side of things. But I've just got this slide here just to sort of highlight some of the the issues that that have frequently come up, uh, in the mining industry. Mining companies, um, have different reputations in different countries. There are different norms, different practises. Um, you may be familiar with, um, issues of cobalt mining in in Democratic Republic of the Congo, um, issues of child labour. And so countries like Australia try and market that. Oh, we have good regulations. We have good practises in Australia. So come in mind here because you can be sure that, uh, any medals that come from Australia are are more ethical than any medals that that come from, uh, Congo. But that then then at the same time, we have a lot of Australian companies that are operating overseas and not necessarily operating to Australian standards. Um, there are many, many, uh, environmental conflicts around the world that impact mining projects. And, um, just in the interest of time, um, many of them are are linked to mining projects. Um, and, uh, they do happen. There certainly are. A lot of, um, there certainly is a lot of community opposition to mining in Australia, uh, whether it's classified as a conflict or not. Um, in some parts of the world, people who try and, um protect the environment or protect the interests of the community against mining companies, um, face violence or backlash. Um, I've done a fair bit of research in Indonesia, uh, where there are a lot of, uh, mining companies that are or mine sites that are protected by paramilitary and so it's virtually impossible for members of the community to voice any concerns around, uh, best practise mine operations. Um, just to talk, uh, a little bit about, uh, lithium. So quite a lot of the world's lithium is produced in Australia, but perhaps the the largest, uh, lithium producing region, um, is in South America in an area that's known as the, uh, the lithium triangle, Um, which encompasses Bolivia, Chile and Argentina. And, uh, in these sites, the A mine looks quite different to to what you might be familiar with, uh, from or to what I showed in my earlier slides here. They're not mining rocks, although you can mine lithium from rocks, which is which is what's done in Australia. Um, but here essentially, you're mining the water the lithium lives in in brines. Uh, underneath these salt flats and essentially, they they pump the the the briny water up to the surface. Uh, they evaporate it in these in these large ponds, and then they collect the lithium that way. Um, and virtually every salt flat, Uh, in Argentina, uh, which is the area that that we looked at, um, has some kind of lithium mine or lithium permit on it. A lot of the communities in this area, uh, which rely on groundwater for their agriculture, have complained that these lithium mines have reduced their access to water. Um, when you have a look at where the lithium concessions are, so that's the the the white outlines and compare it to where people live. So I'm not sure you can quite see there, but in yellow is where the major urban centres are in these provinces. But in red is where indigenous populations are. And so, essentially, what this map shows is that, uh, the the land rights of indigenous people are being routinely ignored by, uh, the government granting permits on top of their land. And they're being disproportionately impacted compared to the rest of, uh, the Argentinian population. So what does responsible mining look like? What does sustainable mining look like? Is there such a thing? So again, coming back to this idea of of of sustainability, being social sustainability, environmental sustainability, economic slash, governance, sustainability, there are a variety of accountability standards out there. So there's, uh, things like Irma, the International Responsible Mining Association. They they have, uh, they have this, um, sort of standard that a mine can try and achieve. And if they say to their investors, Hey, we adhere to these Irma standards, um, you can trust that our product is a good one. And so, uh, and there's also the, um, extractive industry transparency initiative. Publish what you pay. So these initiatives are out there to kind of encourage mining companies to, um, be be a lot more transparent because historically, they're very cagey about what they do. Um, so there are a variety of tech processing technologies that they can apply things like thickened tailings. Um, so where you sort of dewater the tailings and it it it occupies less area, uh, less, uh, less risk of tailings. Dam failures. Um, I didn't really talk about it earlier, but tailings dams can sometimes burst and and flood entire areas. Um, mining companies need to engage with communities, so they need to involve them from the very beginning. What employment opportunities are we going to offer? Do you really want this project to go ahead? If so, under what circumstances? Um, and just finally thinking about so everything I've talked about has been very much the early stages of the of the supply chain, the mining. But of course, impacts happen along the whole supply chain. So it's not like you go. You you don't dig laptops out of the ground. You dig raw materials that need to be processed and and shipped all around the world. And that means that there is a lot of handling and a lot of decisions made by a lot of different companies that all have some kind of responsibility. Um, and how how do we think about consumption and how do we make ethically informed decisions? Wouldn't it be good if we knew where the metals came from in our devices and what the impacts were? Is there some kind of way that this information can be communicated to consumers so that we can actually make reasonable decisions at our end? Then, of course, there is what happens to mines when they close. So Australia has over 80,000 inactive mine sites. Um, many of them not rehabilitated. Um, and many of these sites were operated before the regulations were in place to hold mining companies to account and to, uh, force them to set aside money that would cover, uh, rehabilitation. So there's more than you might think. Um, and who pays for that? Well, very often it's It's up to the the taxpayer to cover these costs. Um, so what do we do about these sites? One option is that we can rehabilitate. Sometimes that can be extremely expensive, depending on the nature of the site. But, um, we can certainly come up with a plan to make the the waste more benign to make the site more safe. Sometimes you've just got a an old mine shaft in the ground that's more of a safety hazard than an environmental hazard. Sometimes you've got sites that have really lingering, um, acid mine drainage issues. Um, that somebody needs to address hams. There is often a decision that needs to be made between. Do we rehabilitate the site, or do we reprocess the site? So, um, Evan mentioned earlier that we didn't really care about lithium until not that long ago. Well, that's also true for a lot of different technology. Metals. Indium, for example, is a metal that's used in L CD displays. Now, for most of human history, it wasn't known, and then it became more of a scientific curiosity, and then we started using it for a variety of different things. And then one day we started using it in l CD displays, and lithium demand goes up like that. But that also means that there are a lot of zinc mines out there. Cos Indium's found in zinc mines that were digging indium out of the ground, but they didn't separate it. They didn't process it. They didn't care about it, know about it, whatever. And so there's actually huge amounts of Indian sitting in waste piles around the world. So can we reprocess these wastes and try and get some money out of these sites at the same time? Uh, as as cleaning them up. Um, so So these are the kind of decisions that that governments and and companies around the world need to make for these tens, hundreds of thousands of sites around the world. Here's a place that I visited during my, um PhD and this is a a slag dump in in northern Tasmania, and it's got 22 tonnes of Indian in it. So that's that's more in Indian than all of Australia's laptops, phones, solar panels, TV s combined, and it's all sitting in one big pile. So a a lot of people have been talking about or should we start collecting e waste and reprocessing e waste and mining our own landfills to get these rare metals? Well, to that, I would say, Just just dig up that one pile there. It's all in the one place and you don't have to steal everybody's stuff. Um, so, uh, these kind of cons considerations are are being made. There are lots of companies that are now revisiting some of these old sites and going, Can we make a buck? And can we use this as a way to more responsibly source some of these metals? So, just as a bit of a summary talked about the the nature of risks in mining, um, it's it's a It's a massive industry. It changes entire landscapes. Thousands, hundreds of thousands of landscapes around the world are impacted, and we need more people, more scientists to look into these impacts and figure out what to do. Um, these challenges are incredibly complex. They require an understanding not just of of, you know, ecology, environmental science, but also about supply chains economics, um, politics, governance issues in order to solve, um, and just touching at the end about ideas for responsible mining. But perhaps you have more ideas as as the next generation of scientists about what we can do to kind of solve these problems. So, yeah, thanks very much. And, um, yeah, if you have any interest or any questions about any of these issues, I'm happy to chat or or email. Thanks, guys. You said so.

SPEAKER 1
Thanks very much for coming along. And, um, if you have any questions, Jim can answer everything.

SPEAKER 2
Thanks. Yeah, I really enjoyed yours too. And so international. No, I thought I thought yours was great. I, um really, do I actually get to just hear someone talk about it, just to just to say that that yeah, and it's It's a great great refresher at the level it is. So, what is your your main sort of area that

SPEAKER 1
I'm interested in useless molecules you find in space. So interested in my quick question, Why has no one

SPEAKER 2
that dump and just taken some of the Indian? Why not? So it's currently owned by a company called Intec, and they're they're looking into it, so they they have a few sort of techno economic challenges to face. Um, so they want to dig it up and rehabilitate the site. Um, but the question is, do they reprocess it right there in Tasmania, or do they ship the materials overseas to another facility that can reprocess it? They need to get investment. Um, and, uh, they need to get support from the government. Um, sometimes these processes can just take a really long time just to build a really clear business case about what to do and to and to weigh up all their options. Um, and the the other thing is that Australia's got a relatively small population, so we don't We don't have that much manufacturing of things like l CD place. So the buyers would likely be someone in South Korea or Japan or something like that. And it can be a lot of work to line up a buyer, uh, for for a large amount of India. Um, so you know, I've I've sort of given these presentations to mining industry and said, Look how much of these rare metals Australia produce and they say, Don't tell us how to make money. We we know what we're doing. Or or sometimes they're just not interested in these in these minor metals. They make so much money out of main metals. And it might just be too much effort for them, um, to to add an extra 2% to their profits or something like that. So they you know, although you could get a really good outcome for that location, um, you could you could get, you know, great environmental outcomes and so on. Sometimes they just say, Oh, it's too hard to ask it. We move on like, Yeah, I It seems like just sitting there, but yeah, I guess it will be you.

SPEAKER 1
A chance to invest.

SPEAKER 2
I'll take care of you. All right. Well, thanks. Thanks. Yeah, leaving very good. Attention.

SPEAKER 1
Go for it. I mean, you can turn it on, right?

SPEAKER 2
I'm Well. Hi. Was this This was, uh, we discovered subject. You
